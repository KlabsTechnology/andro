<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>HTML Generation<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>Andromeda uses an object oriented html system in order to prevent the mix of php and html code
    in andromeda pages.<br/></p>
<p>To make HTML in andromeda, you use the html function, which builds an html element as an
    androHtml object.  The object allows you to modify the element in any way you would normally
    in html.  It is very flexible.<br/></p>
<p>In order to display your object oriented html, you must render it.  Call the render function on your
    androHtml parent object to render the whole page.<br/></p>
