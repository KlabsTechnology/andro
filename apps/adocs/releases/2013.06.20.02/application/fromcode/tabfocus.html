<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>tabFocus<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>The PHP method tabFocus does exactly the same thing
   as tabIndex, with one additional action.  When the page
   loads, this object will start out with focus.<br/></p>
<p>Calling this method more than once while building a page
   causes focus to begin on the last object that made
   the call.<br/></p>
<p>The first time you call tabIndex, it acts like a call
   to tabFocus, so there is no reason to ever call tabFocus
   unless you want focus to begin somewhere other than the
   first tabbable object.<br/></p>
<h2>INPUTS</h2>
<p>int (optional) starting value.  If this value is supplied,
   the object will get this value for its tabIndex, and
   subsequent calls will increment from there.<br/></p>
<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>     &lt;?php
     $div = html('div');
     $input = $div->h('input');
     $input->tabFocus();   // first input should get focus
     // more poperty settings...
     $input = $div->h('input'); // reuse var, make another input
     $input->tabIndex();
     ?&gt;

</pre>
