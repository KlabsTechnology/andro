<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>Javascript API/x6dialogs<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>The two Javascript dialogs x6dialogs.alert and
   x6dialogs.confirm replace the Javascript native functions
   alert() and confirm().<br/></p>
<p>The third dialog, x6dialogs.pleaseWait, puts up a
   suitable notice if your application must do something that
   will take more than 1-2 seconds.<br/></p>
<p>They are all fully modal, respond to appropriate keystrokes
   like 'Y', 'N', 'Enter' and 'Esc', and maintain the same
   style as the rest of the template.<br/></p>
<h2>PORTABILITY</h2>
<p>The x6dialogs object expects your HTML to contain two
   invisible (display:none) divs.  One is called "dialogoverlay"
   and the other is called "dialogbox".  These two divs are
   provided by default on Andromeda templates.  If you make
   your own template and include androHTMLFoot.php at the bottom
   then your templates will also have these divs.<br/></p>
<p>Making a page fully modal is difficult, because if an INPUT
   has focus it will be possible for the user to use the keyboard
   to navigate around.  Therefore the code in x4 checks
   the x6dialogs.currentDialog property, and disallow all activity
   if that property is not false.  If you make your own
   custom pages that are not Extended Desktop pages, you must have
   your input's onkeyPress methods also check this property.<br/></p>
<p>If this object is used outside of Andromeda, you must have
   the file phpWait.php in your public web root, otherwise the
   x6dialogs.confirm function will not work.<br/></p>
