<p>Andromeda automatically builds a menu out of the modules
   and tables in your database.  In addition, you can add
   specific menu entries that go to custom pages.  The
   rules for building a menu are:
</p>

<ul><li>The menu pads take their captions from the
    "description" property of your module definitions.
    <li>The menu pads appear in the order in which they
    are defined in the YAML file, unless overridden
    by the "uisort" property of the modules.
    <li>Each drop-down menu shows the tables within
    the module.
    <li>The tables appear on the menu in the order they
    are defined in the YAML file, unless overridden
    by the "uisort" property of the modules.
    <li>Special menu entries can be defined in the YAML
    file and will appear in the order they are defined,
    or in the order determined by their "uisort" properties.
    <li>Setting the property "spaceafter: Y" on a table or
    menu entry will cause a spacer to appear after that
    entry, so that menus entries can be grouped.
</ul>

<h2>Menu Security and Options</h2>

<p>If a user does not have the "permsel" permission on a table,
   they will not see it on the menu.
</p>

<p>For custom menu entries, we set the "permsel" permission to
   control who can see it on the menu, even though there is no
   real table to SELECT out of.  We do this so the permissions
   work the same way as tables.
</p>

<p>The "nomenu" property can be used to remove a table from
   the menu for all users.  If this property is applied to 
   a module for a group, that group will not see that module
   at all (unless the nomenu property is reset for at least
   one table entry).
</p>

<h2>Custom Pages and Programs</h2>

<p>See the page [[Making Hello World a Menu Entry]] for more
   information on how to put custom programs onto the menu.
</p>

<h2>The Demo Example</h2>

<p>The YAML example shown below is taken from the Andromeda
   Demo application, and has been purged of all information 
   except the module and table definitions, to show how these
   affect the menu:
