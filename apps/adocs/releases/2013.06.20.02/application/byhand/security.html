<p>Andromeda security is based on groups, tables, rows, and columns.
   The programmer defines groups in the database definition, and then
   assigns those groups permissions at various levels to access 
   tables.  The user interface knows about these permissions and
   respects them, so that a user who can read table X but cannot 
   insert into it will see the [NEW] button grayed out.  However,
   the user interface does not actually enforce these permissions,
   enforcement is done within the database server.
</p>

<p>Actual users are given permissions by being put into the
   groups defined by the programmer.  Administrators who have the
   correct permissions can add and delete users and assign them
   to groups.
</p>

<p>Security is <i>cumulative</i>.  A user gains all of the 
   permissions of all of the groups she is in.
</p>

<p>In addition, there are functions available to the programmer in
   PHP to find out what groups a user is in and allow or disallow
   certain programs or routines.
</p>

<p>All security begins by assigning default permissions to a group.
   These permissions can be overwritten at the module level, so that
   a group can be given default permissions in a particular module
   that cascade to all of the tables in that module.  A group can
   then be given specific permissions on a table that override the
   module defaults.  Finally, a group can be given specific row and
   column permissions to filter what they can see and write.
