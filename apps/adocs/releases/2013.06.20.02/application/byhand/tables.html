<p>A table is a top-level definition, meaning that is
   indent level is always zero.  Here is a basic example
   of a table:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ddyaml">
table orders:
    module: ordering
    description: Orders
    uisort: 100
</pre>

<p>The above definition is composed of the following:</p>

<ul><li>The table definition itself, composed of the keyword
    "table" followed by the table name, and a colon.
    <li>The property module is required.  Every table must
    be placed into a module.
    <li>The description is used by the user interface whenever
    the table is referenced.
    <li>The optional uisort property determines where the table
    appears on the menu.  If you leave this out, the tables will
    appear in the order they are defined.
</ul>

<p>A table is not much without some columns in it, the next 
   page will show how to place columns into tables.
