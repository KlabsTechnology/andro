<p>An x6 Plugin is a combination of PHP and Javascript code that
   that provides a complete package of on-screen functionality
   for the user with minimal coding for the programmer.  Plugins
   allow you to assemble custom admin screens with little
   effort.
</p>

<p>Andromeda contains a handful of useful plugins, which are
   used by Andromeda itself to build the x6 admin screens,
   and which you can use to make your own screens.  In this
   chapter we will see how to use plugins, and in the next
   chapter we will see how to make plugins.
