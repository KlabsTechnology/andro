<p>It is possible in Andromeda to define a foreign key and then
   allow inserts that do not match in the parent table.  This
   may seem strange or unnecessary, but there are benefits.
   Andromeda has many user interface features that are driven
   by foreign keys.  If you want to use these features between
   two tables that <i>sometimes</i> match, then you can use the
   unenforced foreign key.
</p>

<p>Use this feature by putting the "allow_orphan" property into
   a foreign key defintion:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ddyaml">
table example_child:
    module: example
    
    foreign_key customers:
        allow_orphan: Y
</pre>
