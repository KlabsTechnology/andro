<p>The Andromeda grid is useful for very simple scrollable lists.
   To make a grid that lists something, you follow these steps:
</p>

<ol><li>Create the grid.
    <li>Define the columns
    <li>Load the Data
</ol>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<?php
class x6example extends androX6 {
    function x6main() {
        # Always begin with this:
        $top = html('div');
        $top->addClass('fadein');
        
        #  ...other html is added here...
        #
    
        # Now for the grid create command.  The parameters are:
        # 1) Height
        # 2) Table we are editing
        # 3) Flag for lookup textboxes, no in this case
        # 4) Flag for sortable.  No
        # 5) Flag for buttonbar, No, not editable
        # 6) Flag for editable, no
        $grid = $top->addGrid(hSize(300),'states','N','N','N','N');
        
        # Now add a single column, take it from the
        # data dictinoary, that is always easiest
        $dd = ddTable('songs');
        $grid->addColumn($dd['flat']['songname']);
        $grid->lastColumn();
        
        # Now pull the data and add it.  Note that we
        # pull the 'skey' column so the grid has a
        # unique ID for each row.
        $view = ddtable('songs');
        $sq="select skey,songname from $view";
        $rows = SQL_AllRows($sq);
        $grid->addData($rows);
        
        
        # ...and this is always at the end
        $top->render();
    }
}
</pre>

<p>This code produces a scrollable read-only grid with a list
   of songs in it.  The grid will be 300px high in 1024x768, and
   it will be scaled appropriately in other skin sizes.
</p>
