<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>ehLogin<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>Provides a login/logout box on the screen.<br/></p>
<p>This routine outputs one of two things.  If a user is logged in,
    it says, "Welcome -Username-!" and gives a logout button.  If nobody
    is logged in, it presents a login box and a password box.<br/></p>
<p>The output is inside of a table.  The items are stacked on top of
    each other, so the first row says "Username:" and the second row has
    a textbox, the third row says "Password:" and the fourth row has
</p>
<pre>     another textbox, and finally the fifth row has a submit button.
</pre>
<p>If CSS_Class is provided, the TABLE and TD elements will both get
    that class asignment.  If the DOM_ID element is provided, the TABLE
    and TD elements will all get that ID assignment.<br/></p>
<p>If the third parameter, Username, is provided, that will be the default
    entry in the UserID box.<br/></p>
<h2>INPUTS</h2>
<p>string $class CSS Class
    string $id DOM ID
