<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>Session Handling<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>Andromeda provides wrappers for accessing session variables.  The
    PHP superglobal $_SESSION should not be directly accessed, instead
    an Andromeda program should use SessionGet and SessionSet.<br/></p>
<p>Do not use session variables for storing information across different
    requests, such as storing user replies going page-to-page through
    a wizard.  Use Context Functions or Hidden Variables
    for these instead, they are much more flexible and robust.<br/></p>
<p>It may happen that you have multiple Andromeda applications on a server,
    and that a browser is connected to more than one of them in multiple
    tabls.  This would result in a collision if you were access $_SESSION
    directly, because each app would overwrite the variables of the others.
    Andromeda prevents these collisions automatically whenever
    SessionGet and SessionSet are used.<br/></p>
<p>Andromeda also prevents collissions between session variables used by
    the framework and those you may put into your application.  All of the
    Session variables accept an optional last parameter (not documented in
    the individual functions)  The default value of this parameter is
    'app', but some framework functions call it with a value of 'fw' to keep
    these variables separate from application variables.  It should be noted
    that sometimes the framework uses application session variables, so that
    the application can find them if necessary.  Examples of this are session
    variables UID (current user_id) and PWD (password of current user).<br/></p>
