<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>addTabGrid<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>The PHP method androHtml::addGrid adds an instance of
   class androHTMLGrid as a child node.
   A "Grid" is a simulated HTML table that uses divs
   instead of TD elements.  The two main reasons for doing
   this are that you cannot put an onclick() routine onto
   a TR in Internet Explorer (as of IE7 oct 2008) and
   the scrollable body is easier to get going on
   a DIV.<br/></p>
<h2>INPUTS</h2>
<p>HEIGHT: The total height of the table including borders,
   header, and footer.<br/></p>
