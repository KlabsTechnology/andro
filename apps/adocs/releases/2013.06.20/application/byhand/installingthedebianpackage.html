title:Installing The Debian Package
parent:Linux
sequence:50
aliases:debian

<p>Our Debian package install has been tested on Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
   on a fresh virtual machine.  We welcome all feedback on the use
   of this package, and we look forward to having it completely
   replace manual installations on Linux.
</p>

<p>The package is not yet tested on newer or older versions of
   Ubuntu or other Debian-based distributions.  However, we 
   believe it ought to work just fine and we welcome feedback.
</p>

<p>We also look forward to having an RPM at some date in the
   future.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<span class="alert">Be sure to be logged in as your regular account
   and to use "sudo" commands to peform the install.  This is 
   important so that file ownerships and permissions will be
   established correctly.
</span>


<p>First download andromeda_0.1.0_all.deb from:
   <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=188856&sel_platform=336"
   >http://sourceforge.net/project/platformdownload.php?group_id=188856&sel_platform=336
   </a>.
</p>

<p>Then type in these two commands:
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint">
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo gdebi andromeda-0.1.0-all.deb
</pre>

<p>Once the installation is complete, point your browser at
   <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost/andro_root/andro"
   >http://localhost/andro_root/andro</a> and log in!  
   Andromeda will be installed with a default user name and
   password of 'start' and 'start'.  The first thing it will
   ask you to do is create a new username and password and then
   it will remove the defaults.
</p>

<span class="info">During the install, your regular Linux 
   user account will be placed into the 'www-data' group.
   You will have to log out and log back in to register the
   change before you can edit program files.
