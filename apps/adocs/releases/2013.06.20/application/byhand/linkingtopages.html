<h2>Simple URLs</h2>

<p>Now that we have a page, we will probably want to link to it.
   Links to Andromeda pages are always made by setting the
   GET parameter "x6page" to the name of the page.  This example
   shows two simple links:
</p>

<h1>A Couple of Links</h1>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<a href="?x6page=helloworld">Link to Hello World</a>
<br/>
<a href="?x6page=helloworld&someparameter=value">Another Link</a>
</pre>

<p>The first link is the bare minimum that you need to get to a 
   page.  You do not need the complete URL such as "http://...."
   You also do not need to name the file index.php because
   Andromeda will go to that file automatically if nothing
   is specified.
</p>

<h2>Pretty URLs</h2>

<p>On some public sites it may be judged unsuitable to have
   long links like "?x6page=xxxxx&amp;parm=5&amp;anotherparm=value...."
   If you prefer, you can write links in this form:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<h1>A Friendly URL</h1>

<a href="pages/helloworld/parm1/value1/parm2/value"
  >This is a Pretty URL</a>
<br/>
<a href="x6page=helloworld&parm1=value1&parm2=value"
  >This link goes to exactly the same place</a>
</pre>

<p>As the example above shows, there are two completely different
   ways to make either link.  The first form, using "pages/...",
   follows these rules:
</p>

<ul><li class="arrows">The first item in the path after "pages"
    will be assigned to x6page.
    <li class="arrows">After the first item, each pair of items in
    the path will be converted to assignments.  In the example above
    parm1 gets the value "value1" and parm2 gets the value "value2"
    <li class="arrows">If there is an odd element left over, it
    is assigned to the parameter "gp0".
</ul>

<h1>Linking to File Downloads</h1>

<p>You can use the pretty URL system to create links to file
   downloads without having to provide direct access to your
   filesystem.  The following URL looks like a simple page
   access:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<a href="pages/downloads/coolmusic.mp3">My Cool Song, Pretty URL</a>
<br/>
<a href="x6page=downloads&gp0=coolmusic.mp3"
  >Same Link, Different Format</a>
</pre>

<p>By following the rules listed above, we know that the first link
   and the second link will go to exactly the same place.  This is
   because:
<ul><li class="arrows">The first argument after "pages" will become
    the value of x6page, as if you had passed in "?x6page=downloads"
    <li class="arrows">There are no complete pairs after "downloads"
    <li class="arrows">There is a leftover parameter at the end,
    so it is assigned to gp0, as if you had put "&gp0=coolmusic.mp3".
</ul>

<p>You can then code up an Andromeda page "downloads" that would 
   be in file application/x6downloads.php and contain class 
   x6downloads.  In the program's x6main() function you can do 
   whatever processing the program may require to determine if the
   user can actually obtain they file they are requesting.
