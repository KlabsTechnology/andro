<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>ddView<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>If a table has row-level or column-level security, then direct
   table access is denied to all users, all access must go through
   views for that table.  This routine returns the name of the view
   that can be used by the currently logged in user.<br/></p>
<p>It is good practice when coding SQL manually to always use
   this routine and never to manually hardcode table names, unless
   you can be completely certain your application will never contain
   row-level and column-level security.<br/></p>
<p>When you use routines like SQLX_Insert and SQLX_Update you
   can use the base table name, those routines do not require you
   to pass in a view name.  Those routines make the call themselves
   to get the view name.<br/></p>
<h2>INPUTS</h2>
<p>array $tabx - Data Dictionary table<br/></p>
<p>RETURN VALUE
    string - the view name of the table<br/></p>
<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a manual query:<br/></p>
<pre>       &lt;?php
       # Employees table has row-level security, so we must
       # find out the name of the view the current user is
       # able to access.
       $view = ddView('employees');
       # Now code the view into an ad-hoc query
       $sql  = "select * from $view where dept='xyz'";
       $emps = SQL_AllRows($sql);
       ?&gt;
</pre>
