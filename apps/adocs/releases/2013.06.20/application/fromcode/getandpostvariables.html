<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>GET and POST Variables<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>This family of PHP functions allows you to retrieve
   HTTP Request parameters.<br/></p>
<p>Andromeda has a special system for obtaining GET and POST
   variables.  When you request a variable, it checks first
   in the $_GET superglobal and next in the $_POST superglobal.
   This frees the programmer from having to track these two
   superglobals independently.<br/></p>
