                            <P CLASS="Textbody">Andromeda uses the term Cross Reference instead of many-to-many. This is not an arbitrary choice. The Andromeda philosophy is to always use the term that most clearly describes the database while being intelligible to the end-user. Everybody knows what a cross-reference is, but not everybody knows what a many-to-many is. Further, the term many-to-many intentionally obscures the fact that there a table present, while speaking of a 'cross-reference table' intentionally makes it plain that such a table is present.</P><P CLASS="Textbody">More information is available in the section on [[Cross References]].</P>
