<p>In the previous lesson we saw how to make a simple "Hello World!"
   page and then we saw how to manually type in a link to see it.
</p>

<p>However, the default for Andromeda is not to allow this page 
   to be seen by anybody unless they are logged in.  So we have to
   make the page public.
</p>

<p>To make the page public, you must create an array called $MPPages
   and add an entry for "helloworld".  Create a file called "applib.php"
   in your application directory and put the following code at the top:
</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'>
<?php
# File: applib.php
#
# Put this at the top, outside of any function
$MPPages = array(
   "helloworld"=>1
);
?>
</pre>

<p>Note the spelling of the array, the first three letters are upper-case
   and the rest is lower case.
</p>

<p>Note also that the page name is the <i>index</i> of the array.  The
   actual value of the entry can be anything, it is ignored.
</p>

<span class="info">If your database application handles any sensitive
  information at all, it is always best to use a <i>deny-by-default</i>
  system, one that denies all access to all tables and pages unless
  a user has been explicitly granted access to the page or table.
  If you are unsure of this, ask yourself, in the event you make
  a mistake, would you rather find you had denied users access to
  something they should see, or would you rather find out that your
  website had been exposing sensitive data to the world?
