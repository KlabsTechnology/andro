<p>The Andromeda documentation contains many pages that are old
   and need to be rewritten, broken up, or combined.  These pages
   are still useful, even though they do not fit into the 
   final flow of the finished docs.
</p>

<p>These pages are stored here for future reference, rewriting,
   etc.  All pages in this section will eventually disappear.
