<p>Fundamental to databases is the idea of putting constraints
   on what data can be written.  Primary keys and foreign keys
   represent the most basic constraints, but the programmer
   will sometimes need specially coded constraints.  This
   section explains how to enforce specialized constraints
   in your Andromeda applications.
