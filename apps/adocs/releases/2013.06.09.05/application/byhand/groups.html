<p>A database group is defined with a name, a description, and
   default system-wide permissions:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ddymal">
# A super-user group that can read-write anything by
# default, though these permissions can be overwritten
# for individual tables.
group supermen:
    description: sysem super-users
    permsel: Y
    permins: Y
    permupd: Y
    permdel: Y
    
# A group that can read anything:
group readitall:
    description: The Auditors
    permsel: Y
    permins: N
    permupd: N
    permdel: N
</pre>

<p>The groups defined above will have the permissions assigned
   to them as listed unless overwritten at the module level or
   at the table level.
</p>

<p>Groups can be defined anywhere in your YAML file, though by
   convention we define them at the top with the modules.  Groups
   are top-level entities, so their first indent is always zero.
</p>

<p>The four permissions "permsel", "permins", "permupd" and "permdel"
   control the four fundamental database operations of SELECT, INSERT,
   UPDATE, and DELETE.
</p>
