<p>Database deletes are best done manually, using an skey
   value, but Andromeda does provide the SQLX_Delete function
   as well.
</p>

<span class="alert">This function is documented for completeness,
  but Andromeda library code does not use it.  Manually coded
  delete commands using skey, while perhaps more tedious to
  write, are much safer.
</span>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<?php
class x6example extends androX6 {
    function x6main() {
        $row = array(
            skey=>1234
        );
        SQLX_Delete('articles',$row);
    }    
}
</pre>

<p>The SQLX_Delete function creates a command that includes
   all of the fields provided in the $row parameter.  
</p>

<p>Providing an skey value in the $row is the only way to
   be certain that exactly one row will be deleted.
</p>

<p>If your $row array contains values that would result in 
   deleting half of the rows in a table -- then that is what
   will happen!
</p>
