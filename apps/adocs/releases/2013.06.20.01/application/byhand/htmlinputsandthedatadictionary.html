title:HTML Inputs and The Data Dictionary

<p>The Data Dictionary is very useful for producing specialized
   HTML.  One of the more tiresome tasks of database development
   is the need to make up specialized inputs for many  
   different fields, with different rules for different types,
   different alignment, different sizes, and so on.
</p>

<p>Andromeda provides the input() function which can be used
   to generate consistent standardized inputs based on the
   information in the data dictionary.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<?php
class x6example extends androX6 {
    function x6main() {
        # Load the dictionary
        $dd = ddTable('configfw');
        
        # Now dump a simple input for each column
        # in the table
        $top = html('div');
        foreach($dd['flat'] as $colname=>$colinfo) {
            $top->h('div',$colinfo['description'].':');
            $input = input($colinfo);
            $top->addChild($input);
        }
        $top->render();
    }
}
?>
</pre>

<p>Each input has special attributes that can be used by browser-side
   code for whatever purpose you may need.  These custom attributes
   always have the letter 'x' as a prefix to their name.  They
   generally have the same name as data dictionary properties except
   they lack underscores:
</p>

<ul><li>xtableid: the table id
    <li>xcolumnid: the column id
    <li>xroupd: If "Y", the column should be read-only when updating
    <li>xroins: If "Y", the column should be read-only for inserts
    <li>xtypeid: Same as "type_id" in the data dictionary
    <li>xcolprec: Same as "colprec" in the data dictionary
    <li>xcolscale: Same as "colscale" in the data dictionary.
</ul>

<h2>Using jQuery to Find Controls</h2>

<p>You can make use of the special attributes that Andromeda adds
   to its inputs to easily find controls that correspond to 
   certain database columns.
</p>

<p>If you want to find the input that is bound to the column
   "group_id" in table "groups", the following jQuery selector
   will do that:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<script>
// Set focus on a particular control
$(':input[xcolumnid=group_id][xtableid=groups]').focus();
</script>
</pre>
