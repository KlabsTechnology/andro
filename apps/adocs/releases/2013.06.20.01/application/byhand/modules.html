<p>A module is first of all a logical container which holds
   tables.  Security assignments can be made to modules which
   cascade down to the tables within it.
</p>

<p>Secondly, modules are used
   to build the administrative menu system.
</p>

<p>A module is not the same as a database schema.  Andromeda
   puts all of its tables into the 'public' schema.  The module
   exists only as a container for tables for organizing menus
   and security.
</p>

<h2>Required</h2>

<p>Every database must have at least one module.</p>

<h2>Module Example</h2>

<p>A module definition can occur anywhere in your .dd.yaml 
   file, although by convention we put them at the top.
</p>

<p>Modules are defined as top-level elements.  That means
   that module definitions have an indent level of zero.
   Here is an example module definition:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ddyaml">
module ordering:
    description: Ordering System
    uisort: 100
</pre>

<p>There are only three elements to a module definition:
</p>

<ul><li>The name is always "module -name-:", the keyword
    <b>module</b>, a space, the name of the module, and a colon.
    <li>The property <b>description</b> is used on the menu
    system.
    <li>The property <b>uisort</b> is used by the menu system
    to order the modules.  If you leave this out, they will
    appear on the menu in the order they are defined.
</ul>
