<p>There are four stamping operations that record the user
   and date/time of inserts and updates.  Using these automations
   you can track the user and time of a row's first insert, and
   the user and time of a row's most recent update.
</p>

<p>There are also four pre-defined columns that use these
   automations, so the simplest way to stamp rows is to use
   the pre-defined column:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ddymal">
table orders:
    # ....details....
    
    # User ID and date/time of insert
    column uid_ins:
    column ts_ins:
    
    # User ID and date/time of last update
    column uid_upd:
    column ts_upd:

</pre>

<p>You can also make up your own columns, or use the pre-defined
   column user_id:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ddymal">
column timestamp:
    type_id: dtime

table orders:
    # ....details....

    # Timestamp an insert and update    
    column timetamp_ins:
        suffix: _ins
        auto: ts_ins
    column timetamp_upd:
        suffix: _upd
        auto: ts_upd
        
    # Record user on insert and update    
    column user_id_ins:
        suffix: _ins
        auto: uid_ins
    column user_id_upd:
        suffix: _upd
        auto: uid_upd
</pre>
