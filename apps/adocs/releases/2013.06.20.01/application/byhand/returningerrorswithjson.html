title:Returning Errors with JSON

<p>If you wish to raise errors to send back to the browser,
   use the x6error() function.  The function takes a single
   argument, a string, which describes the error.
</p>

<p>You can call this function any number of times.  Calling
   this function does not effect your PHP execution at all.
</p>

<p>When you return an error to the browser, all errors
   together will be shown to the user in a popup.  The
   x6.json.process() method will also return false.
</p>
