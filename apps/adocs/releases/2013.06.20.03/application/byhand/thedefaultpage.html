<p>Andromeda decides what page to show a user based on the
   parameter x6page, as in http://www.example.com?x6page=cart.
   However, when the user first lands on a site they have not
   specified a page yet, so there must be a way to send them
   to a meaningful page.
</p>

<h2>The x6home Page Method</h2>

<p>Create a file in your application directory called 'x6home.php'
   and have it contain your home page content.
</p>

<pre class='prettyprint'>
<?php
class x6home extends androX6 {
    function x6main() {
        echo "Welcome to the home page!"
    }
}
?>
</pre>

<h2>Choosing a Page in Code</h2>

<p>You can also code up a routine app_nopage() in your
   application/applib.php file.  This function does not actually
   return a value, it sets a parameter:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<?php
# This file is application/applib.php
#
function app_nopage() {
    if(LoggedIn && !inGroup('customers')) {
        # this is an admin user, send them to the menu
        gpSet('x6page','menu');
    }
    else {
        # this is a public user, send them to the latest
        # news page
        gpSet('x6page','news');
    }
}
</pre>
