<p>Andromeda contains two pre-defined groups.  In the YAML file
   we refer to one as the "$LOGIN" group, and another as the
   "usermaint" group.
</p>

<h2>The $LOGIN Group</h2>

<p>Andromeda is a deny-by-default system, meaning that by default
   all groups are denied access to all tables.  However, on a 
   public website you always need to grant read-only access at least
   to public users who are on the site but have not logged in.
   The most obvious example would be an eCommerce site where the
   users must be able to read the ITEMS table.
</p>

<p>The Andromeda programmer can grant permissions to these public
   users by making assignments to the "$LOGIN" group:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ddyaml">
module inventory:
    group $LOGIN:
        permsel: Y
        permins: N
        permupd: N
        permdel: N
        
# Or, on a specific table:
table items:
    group $LOGIN:
        permsel: Y
        permins: N
        permupd: N
        permdel: N
</pre>

<h2>The USERMAINT Group</h2>

<p>All Andromeda applications contain a group called "usermaint".
   Members of this group are allowed to create and delete users and
   give them group permissions.  Any user in this group has 
   effective control of the entire application, because they can
   create users with any privilege level.
</p>

<p>You do not normally assign any permissions to members of this
   group.
</p>
