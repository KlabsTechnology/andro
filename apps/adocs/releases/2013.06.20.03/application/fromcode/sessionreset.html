<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>SessionReset<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>Destroys all session variables for the current application.  We use this
    instead of PHP session_destroy because it allows a user to be logged in
    to several apps at once, because the framework makes effective sessions
    for each separate application.<br/></p>
<p>Note that this function destroys both application and framework session
    variables, there is more information on what these are on the
    Session Variables page.<br/></p>
