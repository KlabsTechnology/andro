<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>androHtmlxrefs<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>The PHP class androHtmlxRefs generates a tabbed list of child
   tables to the named parent.  Only child tables with the
   "x6xref" property set are included.  The only supported value
   for "x6xref" at this time is "checkboxes".<br/></p>
<p>The object is a subclass of androHtml, and supports all of its
   methods such as addChild, addClass, etc.<br/></p>
<p>IMPORTANT! If there are no qualifying child tables, the object
   is still created and returned, but it will have "display: none"
   and will effectively not exist for the user.<br/></p>
<h2>INPUTS</h2>
<ul><br/><li> string table_id - the parent table
<li> number height - the total height available for the display<br/></ul><br/></ul>
<h2>RETURNS</h2>
<p>object - androHTMLxrefs object.<br/></ul><br/></ul>
