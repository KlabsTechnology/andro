                            <p>Any user who has the 'permins' privelege on a table, that is, who is allowed to insert new rows into the table, will see an [Import] button on that table's screen.  We will use this feature now to load up some customers and items, which will make the tutorial more interesting without requiring a lot of typing.
</p>
<p>The imports are simple.  They expect a CSV file, with no quotes around strings.  They expect the first row to name columns.  Any recognized column will be used, any unrecognized column will be ignored.  Duplicate primary key rows will not be inserted, making it safe to run an import twice w/o corrupting data.
