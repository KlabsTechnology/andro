<p>One of the most important features of Andromeda, after the
   data dictionary, is the 'free' admin screens.  Andromeda 
   automatically generates admin screens for every table in
   your database.  These screens respect all constraints and
   security settings in the database.  For many tables you
   can use these screens as-is, while for others you can
   completely replace them or modify them to your users' needs.
