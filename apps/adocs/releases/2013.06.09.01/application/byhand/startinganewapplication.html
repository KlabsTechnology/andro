Each Andromeda Node has a special program running on it called the "Node Manager" that is used to build, update, and upgrade the other Andromeda applications running on the node. </P><P CLASS="Textbody">To create a new application, launch the node manager. If you have installed with the default instructions, the address will be: </P><P CLASS="Textbody"><A HREF="http://localhost/andro_root/andro/index.php">http://localhost/andro_root/andro/index.php</A> </P><P CLASS="Textbody">Log in using the node superuser user_id and password that you created during the installation. Then from the menu pick "operations", then "applications", then "New Entry": </P><P CLASS="Textbody"><img src="/~kfd/adocs/apppub/caa_ui1.png"/> </P><P CLASS="Textbody">Every Andromeda application requires a code. The Andromeda [[Tutorials]] are all about a finance application with code "finance", so we will do the same thing in this example. For description we will use "Finance Application" and we will name the spec file 'finance.dd.yaml'. The spec file is named after the application, plus the double extension "dd.yaml" makes it recognizable to syntax coloring editors. Make the Web Path "LOCAL" and the Authoritative Node "LOCAL": </P><P CLASS="Textbody"><img src="/~kfd/adocs/apppub/caa_ui2.png"/> </P><P CLASS="Textbody">Then hit the [SAVE] button (or type ALT-S). At this point Andromeda now has a record of your application, but it has not done anything with it yet. To get the ball rolling, click on the link at the top right that says "Build this application": </P><P CLASS="Textbody"><img src="/~kfd/adocs/apppub/caa_ui3.png"/> </P><P CLASS="Textbody">This will popup a window that displays a lot of logging information as the application is built. Once the log is finished you will have a complete skeleton project! </P><P CLASS="Textbody">Although there is nothing to see yet, if you want to login, you can use your superuser and log in at: </P><P CLASS="Textbody"><A HREF="http://localhost/andro_root/finance">http://localhost/andro_root/finance</A> </P><P CLASS="P2"></P><P CLASS="P2">Whenever you have changed the database specification, that is, the finance.dd.yaml file, you can re-run the builder from there. The builder will validate your spec and if it is valid then the builder will apply all of the changes.</P>
