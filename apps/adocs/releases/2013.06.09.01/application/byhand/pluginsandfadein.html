<p>When you create custom admin screens using x6 plugins,
   it is always a good idea to make your page invisible as it
   loads, because some of the plugins do not appear correctly
   until browser-side jQuery plugin code has reformatted them.
   If we did nothing about this, the user would see a page
   load all jumbled looking, then see the page straighten 
   itself out.  This is not very professional, so we would
   prefer them to see the page only after it is all
   straightened out.
</p>

<p>The simplest way to do this is to add the class "fadein" to
   the top-most HTML container on your page.  This will cause
   the page to load invisibly, then all plugins will be 
   initialized so the page is formatted correctly, then the
   page will fade in nicely.

<?php
class x6example extends androX6 {
    function x6main() {
        $top = html('div');
        $top->addClass('fadein');
        
        #
        #  Lots of complex html using fancy jquery
        #  plugins is put here
        #

        $top->render();
    }
}
</pre>
