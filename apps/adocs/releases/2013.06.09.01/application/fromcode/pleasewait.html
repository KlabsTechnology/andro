<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>x6dialogs.pleaseWait<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>The Javascript method x6dialogs.pleaseWait is not,
   strictly speaking, a dialog, because it does not require
   any user feedback, and in fact does not even allow it.<br/></p>
<p>When you call x6dialogs.pleaseWait, a modal box pops up
   that is stylistically consistent with the overall template
   and which has an animated gif and the message "Please Wait".<br/></p>
<p>Use this method when you are executing a long-running
   (greater than 2-3 seconds) process and you must let the
   user know the program is working on something.<br/></p>
<p>The user cannot clear this display.  You must clear it
   yourself when work has been completed by calling
   x6dialogs.clear().<br/></p>
<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>Here is a usage example:<br/></p>
<pre>         x6dialogs.pleaseWait();
         for(var x in rowsToSave()) {
            // some actions to save to server
         }
         x6dialogs.clear();
</pre>
