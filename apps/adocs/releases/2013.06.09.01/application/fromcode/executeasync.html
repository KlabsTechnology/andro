<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>x6.json.executeAsync<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>By default Andromeda sends JSON requests synchronously,
   which is more appropriate for business database applications
   than asynchronous requests.<br/></p>
<p>There are however some times when you do not want the user
   to wait, and so you can make asynchronous calls.<br/></p>
<p>Andromeda does not make use of response handlers, see the
   above section on x6.json for more details.<br/></p>
