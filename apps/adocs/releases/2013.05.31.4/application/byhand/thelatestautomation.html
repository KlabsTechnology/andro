title:The LATEST Automation
parent:Automations
sequence:410
aliases:latest

<p>The LATEST automation saves the most recent value in a
   child table up to the parent table.  Consider the
   following YAML definition.  In it we have a table of
   sporting events, and an automated feed is inserting
   updated scores into a child table.

table games:
    module: sports
    description: Games
    
    # ....various columns here...

    # these two always have the latest
    # score from the child table.
    column score_a:
        suffix: _a
        description: Score Team A
        auto: latest,gamedetails.score_a
    column score_b:
        suffix: _b
        description: Score Team B
        auto: latest,gamedetails.score_b

# As score updates come in over the feed, we insert
# into this table, and the scores are saved up 
# to the game.  This keeps the game updated while
# also preserving a detailed history.
