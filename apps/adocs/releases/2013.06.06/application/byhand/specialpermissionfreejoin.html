title:Special Permission FREEJOIN

<p>Andromeda's security overall provides many safeguards   
   against unauthorized access.  However, sometimes you have a
   public website and you want members of the public to be able
   to come and join without admin intervention to go set them up
   and put them in their groups.
</p>

<p>The "freejoin" group flag can be used to specify that anybody
   can automatically put themselves into a particular group.
   This flag is, in our experience so far, used exclusively for
   public groups like "customers".
</p>

<p>The syntax is simple, you put one flag on a group:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ddymal">
group customers:
    description: Customers
    freejoin: Y
</pre>

<h2>FREEJOIN and SOLO</h2>

<p>In most cases, a FREEJOIN group is also a SOLO group, meaning
   that members of that group cannot be put into any other
   group.  This is the basic configuration for public ecommerce
   sites.
</p>

<p>The reverse is not true, SOLO groups are not always FREEJOIN
   groups.  For instance, a business may hold sensitive information
   for its customers that it makes available on the web.  The users
   will be in a SOLO group, but the business does not just let 
   anybody come along and sign up on their site -- it is only for
   their established customers.  Therefore they will have a SOLO
   group for their customers but there will be no public sign-on
   process and that group will not be a FREEJOIN group.
