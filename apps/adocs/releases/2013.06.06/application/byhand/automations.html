<p>A large part of Andromeda's power comes from its automations.
   Using automations you can embed formulas directly into table 
   definitions, generate history tables easily, have
   materialized views, and do many other things as well.
   Programmers who master 
   Andromeda's automations rarely if ever need to program 
   business logic in their application code, they instead focus on
   getting the business rules correct once in the database and then
   they are free to work on a nice UI.
</p>

<p>Most automations generate values that the end-user is not
   allowed to override, this we call the automation constraint.
   Yet other automations allow either the user or the computer
   to set a value.  Whether or not an automated value can be
   overwritten depends on what the automation is doing and
   whether it makes sense to allow user overrides.
</p>

<p>The automations fall into different families, and each is 
   presented on its own page.
