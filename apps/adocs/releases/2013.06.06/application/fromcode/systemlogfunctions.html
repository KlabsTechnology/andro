<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>System Log functions are used when you must be certain that a log
    entry will be written, even if the current transaction rolls back.
    These kinds of logs are intended for use in debugging or tracking
    invisible processes, such as a Paypal IPN transaction.<br/></p>
<p>A log can be opened with SysLogOpen, which returns a handle to
    the log.  Log entries are made with SysLogEntry and the log is
    eventually closed with SysLogClose.<br/></p>
<p>The logs are stored in tables syslogs and syslogs_e.<br/></p>
<p>The guarantee that the log entry will always be written comes at the
    price of a separate connection to the database for each log.  In a
    debugging situation you can open as many of them as you need, but in
    a production system they should only be used in highest need.<br/></p>
