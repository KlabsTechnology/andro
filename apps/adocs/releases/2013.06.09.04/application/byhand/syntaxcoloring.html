<p>Andromeda has two file types that are specific just to 
   Andromeda.  These are the database specification, which
   always ends in .dd.yaml, and the [[androPage]] files, which
   end in .page.yaml.  Editing these files is much easier
   if you have some type of syntax coloring.
</p>

<p>We currently have syntax coloring files for jEdit, because
   that is what the current contributors are using.  We look
   forward to having other files as they are contributed.
</p>

<p>To make use of the jEdit syntax coloring, copy all of the
   files found at our Sourceforge repository, <a href=
"https://andro.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/andro/trunk/syntax_coloring/jedit/"
>https://andro.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/andro/trunk/syntax_coloring/jedit/</a>
 into your jEdit modes directory.  On Linux this is ~/.jedit/modes.
