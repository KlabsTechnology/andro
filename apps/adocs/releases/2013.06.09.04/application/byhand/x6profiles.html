<p>The Andromeda admin interface makes use of three distinct
   "profiles" for letting users maintain tables.  The profiles
   are called "grid", "twosides" and "conventional".  Each of
   these is shown below, and the "conventional" profile has 
   several pages showing how to extend or modify it.
</p>

<h2>Setting a Table's Profile</h2>

<p>By default all tables have profile "conventional", which is
   the most powerful but also the most complex.  You can change
   a table's profile in your database specification, or in
   your application code.  Application code settings override
   database specifications.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ddyaml">
table example:
    module: testing
    description: An Example Table
    x6profile: grid
</pre>

<p>You can also override this setting in your application code
   by making a dictionary override function for the table and
   setting the x6profile in that:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<?php
#  This function should go into application/applib.php
#
#  It is important that the parameter be passed in by
#  reference, otherwise the function will have no effect.
#
#  Name the function "ddtable_"+ the table name.
#
function ddtable_example(&$dd) {
    $dd['x6profile'] = 'grid';
}
?>
</pre>

<h2>The Grid Profile</h2>

<p>The Grid profile is suitable for small tables that do not have
   many rows or columns.  When the user goes to edit the table,
   the entire table is sent to the browser in a grid form, and the
   user can directly edit the table in the grid.
</p>

<p>Only columns with the "uisearch: Y" flag set will be displayed
   in the grid.
</p>

<p>The grid profile does a little trick if you have a QUEUEPOS
   column in the table.  The grid automatically sorts on that column
   and hides it so users cannot see it.  It then automatically sends
   back inserts that work out the correct value of
   QUEUEPOS for new rows.
</p>
   
<p>Here is an example grid from the demo application:</p>

<h2>The Twosides Profile</h2>

<p>The twosides profile is suitable for small tables that have less
   than a few hundred rows but have too many columns to work well on
   a grid.  This profile shows a grid on the left and a detail pane
   on the right.  When a user clicks on a row on the left, it is brought
   up for editing on the right.
</p>

<p>Here is an example twosides page from the demo application:</p>

<h2>The Conventional Profile</h2>

<p>The conventional profile is the default profile for any table 
   that does not have an explicit profile set.  The conventional 
   profile is far and away the most powerful and flexible way for
   users to work with tables.
</p>

<p>The conventional profile always opens with a lookup screen.  
   Users can directly enter values in any input, and JSON searches
   are performed that retrieve matching values.  Any column that
   has UISEARCH: Y will appear in the lookup grid.
</p>

<p>The user can pick any row and go over to the detail pane, where
   they can also work with child tables, which are populated
   automatically:

   profile.
