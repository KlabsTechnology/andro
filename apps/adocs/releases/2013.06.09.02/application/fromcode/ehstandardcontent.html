<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>ehStandardContent<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>This is the grand-daddy function that must be in every template.<br/></p>
<p>During normal processing, control always passes to some instance of
    x_table2.  That object always echos HTML directly.  However, that
    HTML is being buffered and is captured and saved.  This function
    re-echos that HTML directly, plus it outputs all hidden variables
    and various other essential goodies.<br/></p>
<p>Invoke this command in the main content area of your template.<br/></p>
<h2>INPUTS</h2>
<p>boolean $dotitle True if has title<br/></p>
