title:Calling a Page With Pre-Populated Values

aliases:

<p>Sometimes you want to provide a link on one page that jumps
   directly to an admin screen that already has a row loaded.
</p>

<p>The way to do this is with "pre_" variables in your link.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<!-- This link goes to a normal admin screen -->
<a href="?x6page=customers">Customers</a>


<!-- this link goes to a specific customer -->
<a href="?x6page=customers&pre_customer=1234">Customer 1234</a>

<!-- While this link will find maybe more than one -->
<a href="?x6page=customers&pre_description=A"
   >Customers Starting With 'A'</a>
</pre>

<span class="info">This feature only works with the 
   conventional profile.</span>
   
<p>When a page is loaded with "pre_" values, Andromeda executes
   a search before the page displays, and either:
</p>

<ul><li>If there is exactly one match, the display appears 
    already set on the detail screen for that match.
    <li>If there are no matches or more than one, the display
    appears on the lookup screen.
</ul>
