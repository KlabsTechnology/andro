title:The SKEY Column
parent:Database Access
sequence:125
aliases:

<p>Every table in an Andromeda database contains a column
   called "skey", which contains a unique integer value.
</p>

<p>The skey value is very handy in user interface programming
   where you often are working with only one row.  If you make
   it a practice to always retrieve this value, it is very
   useful as a unique identifier for HTML elements.  The
   skey value also makes
   it very easy to code manual updates and deletes, and
   it also makes it easier to use the SQLX_Insert, SQLX_Update
   and SQLX_Delete functions.
</p>
   

<span class="info">The SKEY Column is not a primary key
   and cannot be used as a foreign key in other tables.
   A row's skey value should never be saved in other tables
   as a reference to the original row -- always use your
   own primary key instead.
