<p>Andromeda contains framework-level support for Paypal.  Using
   paypal involves coding two routines and understanding how to
   track your purchase.

<p>Andromeda also contains support for Authorize.net, but this is not
   yet mature and is not documented.  The good news however is that
   Authorize.net is so much simpler than Paypal that it can be used
   largely w/o framework support.
