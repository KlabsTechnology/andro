title:Special Permission SOLO
parent:Security
sequence:600
aliases:solo

<p>A group can be flagged as a "SOLO" group.  This means members of
   this group cannot join any other group.  This flag is useful
   when customers are given access through a public website to your
   database.  You can make the customer group "solo", so that 
   customers cannot be accidentally (or intentionally) given 
   membership in more privileged groups.
</p>

<p>The syntax is simple:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ddyaml">
group customers:
    description: Customers
    
    # Deny all access by default, they
    # will be given certain permissions
    # at module and table level.
    permsel: N
    permins: N
    permupd: N
    permdel: N
    
    # This flag makes the group 'solo', members
    # of this group cannot join any other group,
    # and vice-versa.
    solo: Y
</pre>
