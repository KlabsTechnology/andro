<p>Your Andromeda Web programming will really begin to take
   off once you begin using the data dictionary.  All Andromeda
   applications begin with a very thorough and powerful data
   dictionary.  This dictionary is not just for the
   database, it is also good for generating HTML.
</p>

<p>When we are defining a database for an application, we edit
   a plaintext file in YAML format.  This format would be 
   of little use while coding PHP, so Andromeda packages it
   up into associative arrays that you can load and use
   in your PHP code.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<?php
class x6example extends androX6 {
    function x6main() {
        # Andromeda contains a built-in table called
        # 'configfw'.  We can load the data dictionary
        # for this table with this command:
        $dd = ddTable('configfw');
        
        # Now lets dump the array out.
        echo "<div style='width: 500px; height: 500px; overflow:scroll'>";
        hprint_r($dd);
        echo "</div>";
    }
}
?>

</pre>

<p>When you need to know about a table, you call the 
   ddTable({tablename}) function, and it returns an associative
   array that completely describes the table, including all columns,
   primary keys, and many other features.
</p>

<p>Repeated calls to ddTable() for the same table are harmless,
   except for the negligible performance penalty that is required
   for Andromeda to reload the dictionary.
</p>

<h2>Simple Dictionary Uses</h2>

<p>This example shows how to load the dictionary and then run out
   a list of the columns in the table.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<?php
class x6example extends androX6 {
    function x6main() {
        # Another built-in table is the 'groups' table,
        # which describes the application group definitions.
        $dd = ddTable('groups');
        
        # For the HTML we will now loop through the
        # "flat" array of the dictionary, which holds 
        # the column definitions.
        $top = html('div');
        
        # Make the Title from the table description
        $top->h('h1','All about '.$dd['description']);
        
        # Now the loop
        $ul = $top->h('ul');
        foreach($dd['flat'] as $colname=>$colinfo) {
            $ul->h('li',"$colname: {$colinfo['description']}");
        }
        
        $top->render();
    }
}
?>
</pre>

<span class="info">Why is the list of columns called "flat" instead
   of "columns"?  It's a long story, it made sense back in August of
   2004, and that's what it has been ever since...
</span>

<h2>Basic Table Properties</h2>

<p>Using the data dictionary, you can find out the following
   facts about a table:
</p>

<ul><li><b>description</b>: Standard description of table
    <li><b>singular</b>: the singular form of the description.  If no value
        is provided in the dd.yaml file, the Andromeda looks for an 's'
        at the end of the description and removes it.  Usually you
        assign this value when that does not work, so if you have a table
        named "STORIES", you would want to specify "STORY" in the
        data dictionary.
    <li><b>module</b>: The module the table is in.
    <li><b>nomenu</b>: If "Y", this table does not usually appear on the menu
    <li><b>viewname</b>: If there is no row or column level security on the
        table, this will be the table name.  If there is row or column
        level security, this will hold the view name that the currently
        logged in user must go through instead.        
    <li><b>permrow</b>: Will be "Y" if there is row-level security on
        this table.
        <b>permcol</b>: Will be "Y" if there is column-level security
        on this table.
    <li><b>pks</b>: A comma-separated list of the primary key columns
        of the table, in the order they were defined.
</ul>


<h2>Table Projections</h2>

<p>There are three more bits of information you can get about a 
   table.  You can find out about the table's parents, children,
   and projections.
</p>


<p>The array $dd['projections'] is an associative array.  The
   index key names the projection, and the values are comma-separated
   lists of columns in each projection.  Every table has these 
   projections:
</p>

<ul><li class="arrows"><b>_primary_key</b>: The list of primary key
    columns, holds the same values as $dd['pks'].
    <li class="arrows"><b>_uisearch</b>: The list of columns for 
    which uisearch is set to "Y".
    <li class="arrows"><b>_uino</b>:  Columns the user should not
    see.  These include some Andromeda-created columns and any columns
    that have uino equal to "Y" in the dd.yaml file.
</ul>

<span class="warn">Setting a column's uino to "Y" is not a security
   measure.  It is only a convenience to prevent Andromeda from 
   displaying the value.  To find out how to securely protect
   columns, see more at Column-Level Security.
</span>
   
<h2>Parent And Child Tables</h2>

<p>The data dictionary for a table has two more arrays,
    named $dd['fk_children'] and $dd['fk_parents'].  Each of these
    is an associative array where the key is the name of the
    parent/child table and the value is another associative array.
    The nested array contains all of the basic properties of the
    parent/child table listed in the above section such as 
    description, singular, pks, etc.  The array also has these
    additional entries:
</p>

<ul><li class="arrows"><b>cols_chd</b>: Comma-separated list of
    columns in the child table that make up the foreign key.
    <li class="arrows"><b>cols_par</b>: Comma-separated list of
    columns in the parent table that make up the primary key.
    <li class="arrows"><b>cols_both</b>: Comma-separated list of
    column pairs that match the parent to child table.  The
    pairs themselves are colon-separated, and always list the
    child table column first followed by the parent table column.
</ul>

<h2>Basic Column Properties</h2>

<p>Column properties are stored in $dd['flat'], where each 
   entry's key names the column and each entry's value is
   a child array of column properties.  The properties of
   a column are listed below.  For more information on these
   properties, please refer to documentation on the Data 
   Dictionary.
</p>

<ul><li>table_id
    <li>column_id 
    <li>type_id char
    <li>colprec
    <li>colscale
    <li>description 
    <li>descshort 
    <li>tooltip
    <li>primary_key
    <li>range_from 
    <li>range_to 
    <li>pk_change
    <li>suffix 
    <li>prefix  
    <li>automation_id
    <li>auto_formula 
    <li>sqloffset 
    <li>sqllimit 
    <li>value_min 
    <li>value_max 
    <li>uirows 
    <li>uicols 
    <li>uisearch  
    <li>ins 
    <li>uiro  
    <li>uino  
    <li>dispsize (calculated display size)
</ul>  

<h2>Modifying The Dictionary At Run Time</h2>

<p>Sometimes you may want to make small changes to the data 
   dictionary, such as setting a column's description, but you
   do not want to run a build.  You can create a function that will
   modify the data dictionary after it is loaded and before it is
   given to the original requesting program.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<?php
# This is file application/applib.php

function ddtable_groups(&$dd) {
    # for some reason we want to pretend this
    # column does not exist
    unset($dd['flat']['group_id']);
}

function ddtable_orders(&$dd) {
    $dd['singular'] = "Order";
}
?>

</pre>
