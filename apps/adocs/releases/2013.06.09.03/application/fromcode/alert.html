<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>x6dialogs.alert<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>The Javascript method x6dialogs.alert replaces the native
   Javascript alert() function with one that is stylistically
   consistent with the rest of the application.<br/></p>
<p>Unlike Javascript's native alert() function, execution
   continues after you call this function.  The user must
   clear it by clicking the OK button, hitting Enter, or
   hitting Esc.<br/></p>
<p>When this alert is active, all keyboard events are
   suppressed except Enter and Esc.<br/></p>
<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>Here is a usage example:<br/></p>
<pre>       x6dialogs.alert("New data has been saved");
       // maybe do some other stuff while
       // waiting for the user
       u.events.notify('myEventName',objParms);
</pre>
