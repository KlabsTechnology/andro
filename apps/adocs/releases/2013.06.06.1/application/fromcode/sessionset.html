<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>SessionSet<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>This program sets a session variable.  The variable will exist
    as long as the PHP session is alive.<br/></p>
<p>The framework tracks only 2 session variables.  These are UID, which
    is user_id, and PWD, which is user password.  An application must be
    careful not to overwrite those values, as the framework will make no
    provision to prevent such an accident.<br/></p>
<h2>INPUTS</h2>
<p>string $key - key to set
    mixed $value -    value to set to $key<br/></p>
<h2>SOURCE</h2>
<pre class='prettyprint'>
function SessionSet($key,$value,$sfx='app') {
   $xkey=$GLOBALS["AG"]["application"]."_".$sfx."_".$key;
    $_SESSION[$xkey] = $value;
}</pre>
