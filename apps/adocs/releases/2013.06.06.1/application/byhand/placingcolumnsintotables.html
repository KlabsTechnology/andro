<p>So far we have seen that tables are organized into modules,
   and that columns are defined outside of tables and then
   placed into them.  We will now see how to do this.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ddyaml">
table orders:
    module: ordering
    description: Orders
    uisort: 100
    
    # In this example, we will use all pre-defined columns
    column recnum:
        description: Order Num
        primary_key: Y
    column first_name:
        uisearch: Y
    column last_name:
    column add1:
    column add2:
</pre>

<p>In the above example, we see that the columns are indentented and
   name one-by-one in the familiar pattern of "column -name-:".  Any
   additional properties we set for the columns then appear indented
   another level.
</p>

<span class="info">
You cannot modify the type, precision or scale of a column when placing
it into a table, but you can modify just about anything else.  In fact,
much of the power of Andromeda comes into play when you enable
automations on columns.
</span>

<p>All of the columns we have put into the table so far are 
   pre-defined columns.  Andromeda has defined them in a separate file
   and they are available to all of your applications.  
</p>   

<h2>A Note About the recnum Column</h2>

<p>The recnum column is a pre-defined int column that automatically
   gets incrementing values with each inserted row.  This is similar
   to the "order_id" column you see in many systems.
</p>

<p>If you prefer to have a column named "order_id" that 
   auto-increments, you may want to jump ahead to the page 
   on the sequence automation.
</p>

<h2>Overriding the Description</h2>

<p>The pre-defined column "recnum" has a built-in description of
   "Generic Record Number".  This is not really something we want plastered
   on our admin screens, so we have changed the description when placing
   the column into the table.
</p>

<h2>The primary_key Flag</h2>

<p>Every table must have a primary key composed of at least one column.
   In the above example, the "recnum" column is the primary key.  If you
   have a table with a compound primary key you just set the flag on
   all appropriate columns.

<h2>The uisearch Flag</h2>

<p>Andromeda builds a very powerful admin interface for you, but it needs
   to know a few things about how you want to display your table to the
   users.  The "uisearch" flag means that this column will be used on
   grids and lookup screens.
</p>

<p>Every table requires at least one column to have uisearch set to yes.
</p>

<h2>Renaming Columns</h2>

<p>Andromeda lets you place the same column into a table multiple times
   with different names.  The new column name <i>always is built from
   the original column name</i>, either by adding a suffix, a prefix,
   or both.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-ddyaml">
table example:
    # detail....
    
    column add1:
    column new_add1:
        prefix: new_
    column add1_old:
        suffix: _old
    column x_add1_y:
        prefix: x_
        suffix: _y
</pre>

<p>In this example we have created four columns that all have the same
   type, precision, scale, and description as "add1".  For each column,
   we specify it with its complete name, then we add the prefix and
   suffix parameters so that Andromeda can figure out what is going on.
