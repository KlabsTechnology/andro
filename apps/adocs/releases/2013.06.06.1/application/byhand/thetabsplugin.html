<p>Tabbed displays are a staple of modern computer programs
   and web sites.  Thanks to the good folks at the jQuery UI
   team, we have a nice tab bar ready to go.  The only drawback
   is that the ui-tabs jQuery plugin wants our HTML assembled
   in a certain way.  Since this is a repetive task, Andromeda
   provides a way to do it easily - the tabs plugin.
</p>

<p>The x6 plugin "tabs" gives you a very easy way to generate
   and manage the caption and content of your tabs.  Here is 
   a complete example:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<?php
class x6example extends androX6 {
    function x6main() {
        $top = html('div');
        
        #  Get us an empty tab bar.  The first parameter
        #  is a unique id for the tabs bar, the second
        #  is the height in pixels of the content panes.
        $tabs = $top->addTabs('uniqueid',hSize(500));
        
        #  Make the first tab by calling addTab() and
        #  giving it the caption for the tab.  It will
        #  return a DIV element in which you can put the
        #  content.
        $tab1 = $tabs->addTab('Caption For First Tab');
        $tab1->h('h1',"I am content of the first tab");

        #  make the second tab the same way
        $tab2 = $tabs->addTab('A Second Tab');
        for($x = 0; $x < 10; $x++) {
            $tab2->h('div',"This is line $x in the second tabe");
        }
    }
}
?>
</pre>

<h2>Keyboard Accessibility</h2>

<p>Tabs are automatically assigned numbers, beginning with zero,
   so that the actual captions in the above example will be
   '0: Caption for the First Tab' and '1: A Second Tab'.
   The user can hit CTRL+Number to jump between tabs without
   using the mouse.
</p>

<h2>Using jQuery UI-tabs Functionality</h2>

<p>You may wish to have Javascript that makes use of the 
   many functions available in the jQuery UI-tabs plugin.
   You can make use of all of the functionality by making use
   of the unique ID that was used when the tab bar was
   created.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<script>
$('uniqueid').tabs('select',1);
</script>
</pre>
