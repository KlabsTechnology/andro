<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>x6dialogs.confirm<br/></p>
<h2>FUNCTION</h2>
<p>The Javascript method x6dialogs.confirm replaces the native
   Javascript confirm() function with one that is stylistically
   consistent with the rest of the application.<br/></p>
<p>Like Javascript's native confirm() function, execution<br/></p>
<ul><br/><li>stops* until the user answers the question.  This makes   coding far easier because you do not have to code   anonymous callback functions.<br/></ul>
<p>When this alert is active, all keyboard events are
   suppressed except 'Y' and 'N'.<br/></ul><br/></ul>
<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>Here is a usage example:<br/></ul>
<pre>       if(x6dialogs.confirm("Do you really want to delete?")) {
           // code to delete
       }
       else {
           u.events.debug("user chose not to delete");
       }
<br/></ul>
<h2>PORTABILITY</h2>
<p>Javascript does not natively support an elegant way to
    pause execution.  For instance, it does not have a
    "sleep" function that would allow a low-CPU idefinite
    loop to be executing while waiting for user input.<br/></ul>
<p>We could solve this by throwing caution to the wind and
    doing an indefinite loop anyway, which checks over and over
    to see if the user has responded, but this spikes CPU usage
    and is very bad form.<br/></ul>
<p>The technique used by x6dialogs.confirm is unusual, but it
    has the benefit of being extremely low on CPU power and
    extremely low on network bandwidth.  The approach contains
    an indefinite loop that makes a call to the program
    phpWait.php, which does a sleep for 1/4 second and returns.
    Even at four calls per second, the overall CPU and network
    bandwidth is practically zero.<br/></ul>
<p>Therefore, x6dialogs.confirm has a dependency that the
    php file phpWait.php be present in the web server's public
    root.  This is handled automatically by Andromeda, but you
    must provide such a file if you use this object in
    a non-Andromeda application.<br/></ul><br/></ul>
