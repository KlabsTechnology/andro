<p>Andromeda's full set of database programming features
   includes dozens of automations, switches, and flags
   that, when taken together, can be used to fully specify
   a database and its application logic together in a single
   place.  The Andromedda builder program then builds the
   database and generates code that enforces the entire
   specification.  
</p>

<p>Andromeda database programming
   features fall into these categories:</p>

<ul><li><b>Database Structure</b> - the basic definition of tables,
    columns, keys and indexes.
    <li><b>Automations</b> - automatically generating values
    from other values, copying values from one table to 
    another, generating histories.
    <li><b>Security</b> - restricting which groups can
    access which tables, and restricting which groups
    can access specific columns or rows within a table.
    <li><b>Constraints</b> - Preventing an update or delete
    under certain conditions, or disallowing certain
    values in columns.
    <li><b>Extensions</b> - extensions to basic database
    concepts, such as ranged primary key (begin and end values
    that may not overlap), and additional foreign key
    features.
    <li><b>UI Information</b> - additional information
    that is used by the user interface.
</ul>    
    
<p>The following pages detail how to make use of these features.
