<h1>Data is More Valuable Than Code</h1>
                            
<P>
Anybody who has worked in the software industry for more than a few weeks knows 
that the customers value their data far more than their code. The evidence for 
this is simple: they will pay you to throw away and replace their programs so 
long as you can preserve their data. 
</P>

<P>
This leads to the first principle of Andromeda, "Data is more Valuable Than 
Code". The purpose of Andromeda is to put programmers into the same position as 
our customers, a position where our primary asset is the data files we produce 
instead of the programs we write. 
</P>

<P>
Let us take it as a given that a certain database project, such as an 
accounting or ERP system, is going to be built. There are basically two ways 
to do it. 
</P>

<P>
Method A invests 20,000 hours (5 programmers for two years) into producing code 
for the latest state-of-the-art platform (the world wide web, for instance). 
</P>

<P>
Method B invests the same 20,000 hours, but spends 4,000 hours creating an 
Andromeda-style "builder" and invests the other 16,000 hours into a body of data 
that is fed into the builder to make the database and the code. 
</P>

<P>
We will say that the product in both methods has been built using SEEK-WELL 
SERVER. A crucial client now demands that rival product SEE-ME/2 be used. What 
must happen? In a contrived case like this there are many guesses, but we may 
say perhaps that each group finds they must modify 20% of their code. Group A 
now has 4000 hours ahead of them, or two person-years, while Group B has 800 
hours, or two programmers for three months. 
</P>

<P>
A similar scenario comes up when the "State of the art" application begins to 
age, and newer competitors are coming out with apps that run on hand-held devices. 
What are the options now? The folks with Method A can A) Buy another company with 
an inferior but sexier product or B) Repeat the 20,000 investment. The folks in 
Method B will at worst repeat their entire 4000 hours of work, but more likely 
they will only repeat a fraction of it. 
</P>

<P>
These scenarios are one of the reasons why we believe that code is a depreciating 
non-portable asset while data is a portable and appreciating asset. 
</P>

<P>
The practical result of this thinking is Andromeda's placement of all business 
rules into the Database Specification, which is itself only a data file, so that 
the Andromeda builder can do the actual job of writing the server-side code to 
implement the rules. This accomplishes the goal of shifting a lot of the programmer's 
assets into data. It does not completely make the shift because a program will 
always have some UI code for different platforms.
