            <h1>GET-POST Variables</h1>
                            
<p>Andromeda combines the PHP superglobals <span class="syntax10">$_GET</span>
and <span class="syntax10">$_POST</span> into one array.  The POST variables
are processed first, and then the GET variables are processed,
so that a GET will override a POST of the same name.  This feature
is entirely for the convenience of the programmer so that you do not
have to distinguish between these two sources.
</p>
<p>Unlike many systems, Andromeda does <b>not want to sanitize</b>
or in any way modify the data that comes in through POST/GET.
There are two reasons for this:
</p>
<ul><li>The sanitation process is different for a browser or a database,
and sanitizing for one corrupts for the other.  Therfore we
<a href="coding.html#5">Sanitize when Sending</a>.
<li>You may need to handle the raw data.
</ul>
<p>The "no-sanitization" policy runs counter to the default installation
of PHP5.  By default PHP5 has a setting turned on called
<a class="phpfunc" href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.info.php#ini.magic-quotes-gpc">magic-quotes-gpc</a> which modifies data.  During the
processing of GET-POST Variables, Andromeda detects this setting.
If the setting is turned on, Andromeda will pass the data through
<a class="phpfunc" href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stripslashes.php">stripslashes()</a> to return it to its original state.
However, there is a small chance that this process will not return
the exact value originally posted, so if you have a server used
exclusively for Andromeda, you should turn off
<a class="phpfunc" href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.info.php#ini.magic_quotes_gpc">magic_quotes_gpc</a> in PHP.INI.

<h1>Reading Variables From A Request</h1>
<p>You can pull any value from the current request with the [[gp]] function,
which takes as its arguments the variable name.
</p>
<p>You can find out if a variable was posted in by passing the variable name to
the [[gpExists]] function, which returns true or false.
</p>
<p>You can capture a family of variables into a <span class="nolink">row array</span> with the
function [[rowFromGP]], which takes as its single argument a string prefix.
All variables whose name begins with that prefix will be put into the array
that is returned.  The key names will have the prefix itself stripped off.
</p>
<p>You can set the value of a posted variable, to make it look to later code as
if it came from the browser, with [[gpSet]].  A variable set
this way does not go out to the browser, it appears as if it came in on the
current request.  You can set the value of hidden variables that will go
back to the browser with the [[Hidden]] function.
</p>
<h1>Writing Variables</h1>
<p>You can set the value of a hidden variable that will go out to the browser with
[[Hidden]] which takes as its arguments a name and a value.  This is not the
same as using [[gpSet]], because the former puts a value onto the form that
will be sent to the browser, and therefore returned on the next request, while the
latter "fakes" the appearance of a variable coming in on the current request.
