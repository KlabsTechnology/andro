<p>
Accepts the name of a table and returns the appropriate view to
access based on the user's effective group.
</p>

<p>
The name of a view is only returned if there is some reason to redirect
the user to a view.  In very many cases, oftentimes in all cases, the
function returns the base table name itself, such as:
</p>

<ul><li> If no column or row security is on the table
<li> If the user is a root user
<li> If the user is the anonymous (login) user
</ul>
