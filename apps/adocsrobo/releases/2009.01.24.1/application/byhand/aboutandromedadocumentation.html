<h1>About Andromeda Documentation</h1>

<P>
Good documentation is second only to masterful design in making a good program. 
The best system in the world is only as useful as its documentation, and so the 
Andromeda philosophy is to strive for the best possible documentation.
</P>

<P>
Our gold standard for documentation is the online PHP docs. Every nook and cranny 
of Andromeda should be documented with the same thoroughness that we see in the 
PHP docs.

<P>
I am most comfortable using a Word Processor to generate technical documentation, 
and OpenOffice.org has provided a Word Processor that is Good Enough in all respects. 
So I use OpenOffice.org for the tutorials and explanations, and embedded docs in 
the source code for reference:

<P>
The final product for page-by-page viewing is HTML with CSS styling. The final 
product for a complete set of docs is PDF.

<H2><A NAME="What_We_Mean_By__E2_80_9CPage_E2_80_9D"></A>What We Mean By <q>Page</q></H2>

<P>
The term <q>page</q> refers to the distinct content the user sees on the screen when 
they click a link. If they click on the <q>Widgets</q> link we say they will go to the 
widgets page.

<P>
Use <q>Heading 1</q> to denote a distinct page. Everything before the first is discarded 
<q>Heading 1</q>, and each subsequent <q>Heading 1</q> will break to a new page. 
</P>

<P>
Use <q>Heading 2</q> and <q>Heading 3</q> within a document. No further nesting of 
header-level styles is defined in the style sheet.
</P>

<P>
Modify the styles in OO.org to your own liking, it will not affect the display 
on the site.
</P>

<P>
Make a style called <q>code</q> and use it for code snippets.
</P>

<P>
Make a style called <q>parms</q>. At some point each page needs a <q>parms</q> section that 
defines the parent page of that page. 
</P>

<P>
Empty elements and page breaks are not sent to the final output, so feel free to 
use page breaks and blank lines as needed.

<P>
Application documents are stored in the 'docsapp' directory of the application.

<H3><A NAME="The_Last_Step"></A>The Last Step</H3>

<P>
When you have a document ready to be published, export it to xhtml using OO.org's 
built-in exporter. The Andromeda documentation generator only looks for the xhtml 
files, it ignores everything else.

<H2><A NAME="Pending_Jobs_To_Improve_Documentation"></A>Pending Jobs To Improve Documentation</H2>

<P>
The following jobs are waiting for somebody to come up and improve this system.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="Need_to_Define_CSS_Classes"></A>Need to Define CSS Classes</H3>

<P>
We need to completely define the list of classes that are needed for Andromeda 
docs. These would include source code from PHP, HTML, JS, CSS, and YAML.
</P>

<P>
In a related matter, we need an easy way to paste in syntax-colored examples.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="The_Docs_Generator"></A>The Docs Generator</H3>

<P>
The docs generator needs to be improved to scan documents for references to other 
pages and convert them to hyperlinks.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="Docs_in_Source_Code"></A>Docs in Source Code</H3>

<P>
We need to consider if we can simplify the docs-in-comments. Right now they've 
got some pretty nifty stuff that happens to be very different from the newer OO.org 
stuff. I am seriously considering dropping the embedded comments and moving those 
docs into OO.org text files.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="Put_In_User_Comments"></A>Put In User Comments</H3>

<P>
We need somebody to put in user comments on all pages.
