<h1>Directories</h1>
                            
<p>
Every Andromeda application has a standard set of directories, with one
root and its collection of subdirectories.  All of the code for every 
application, including public files, script libraries, CSS files, and 
server code, is contained in this directory tree.
</p>

<p>
The top level directory normally holds <span class="nolink">index.php</span> and [[pages]], plus
an .htaccess file.
</p>

<p>
The standard sub-directories are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>application</b>.  Holds all application-specific server-side code.
During a build, the builder writes an .htaccess file to this directory
containing only the line "Deny From All", so that the directory is not
publicly visible.
<li> <b>appclib</b>.  Holds all application-specific client-side code.
<li> <b>apppub</b>.  Holds all application-specific client-side images and other publicly available files.
<li> <b>instpub</b>.  Instance-level publicly-visible files.
<li> <b>lib</b>.  Andromeda server-side library files.
<li> <b>clib</b>.  Andromeda client-side library files.
<li> <b>dynamic</b>.  A cache directory, used by the framework to store anything
that needs rapid retrieval.  Wiped out during a build.
<li> <b>generated</b>.  Contains the data dictionary, converted into PHP include
files which themselves hold associative array definitions.  Allows the
data dictionary to be loaded in a pre-packaged format perfect for use by
PHP code.  Wiped out during a build.
<li> <b>files</b>.  A catch-all directory where files can be put during development.
Nothing in here is handled during builds, and the source control and version
control systems ignore it, so it is a good place to put files on dev systems.
<li> <b>tmp</b>.  Used during a build to put log files and such.  Ignored by the
version and source control systems.
</ul>
