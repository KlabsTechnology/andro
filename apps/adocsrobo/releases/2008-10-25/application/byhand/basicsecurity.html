<h1>Basic Security</h1>
                            
<P>
Andromeda follows the basic database security model of defining groups and then granting 
the ability to groups to select, insert, update, or delete from tables. 
</P>

<P>
Since it can be tedious to grant many combinations of privileges to many tables, Andromeda 
allows you do define a "module". A module has no meaning inside of the database, it does 
not correlate to a schema or namespace or anything like that. It is simply a logical 
grouping of tables, and one of the things you can do is assign a group privileges on 
an entire module.
</P>

<P>
Andromeda is strictly DENY BY DEFAULT. When you first create a database, nobody can 
access any of the tables in the database. You must at the very least assign SELECT privileges 
on at least one table to at least one group, or you haven't got an application. Andromeda's 
privileges are also cumulative. Each time a user is assigned to a group, they gain all of 
the privileges of the group. There is no concept of denying access to any table for a user, 
if you don't want them in a table then take them out of the group that has access.
</P>

<P>
There is more information on basic security in the reference pages on [[module]], [[group]], 
[[module.group]], [[group.module]], and [[table.group]].
