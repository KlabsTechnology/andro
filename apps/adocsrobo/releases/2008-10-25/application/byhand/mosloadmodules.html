                            <p>string Module_name<br/>number Unknown<br/><br/><br/>Looks for the function [[appLoadModules]] to exist.  If that routine
exists, it is called.  That routine is expected to echo its output
directly.  If that routine does not exist, nothing happens.
</p>
<p>Define and code the method [[appLoadModules]] in your [[applib.php]] file.
</p>
<p>One handy way to explore a template is to code [[appLoadModules]] so that
it simply echoes the name of the module, that way the template will appear
with all of the module areas displaying their names.
