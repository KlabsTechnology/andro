                            <p>string Var_Name<br/>any Default_Value<br/>any<br/><br/><br/>This program returns a session variable.  The second parameter
is a [[Standard Default Value]] and will be returned if the
Session variable Var_Name does not exist.
</p>
<p>The framework itself tracks only 2 session variables.  These are UID, which
is user_id, and PWD, which is user password.  An application must be
careful not to overwrite those values, as the framework will make no
provision to prevent such an accident.
