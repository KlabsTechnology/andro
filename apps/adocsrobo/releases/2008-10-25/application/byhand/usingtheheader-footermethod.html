            <h1>Using The Header-Footer Method</h1>
                            
                            <p><br/><br/>If you wish to build a site using the [[Header-Footer Method]], you
only need to put a couple of lines into your header include file:
</p>
<div class="box-php">$header_mode=true;
include('index.php');
</div>
<p>These lines will do everything that Andromeda normally does, including
loading libraries and processing [[GET-POST Variables]].
</p>
<p>There are some things you must do yourself inside of each page if you
intend to use this method.  For instance, if you have used the [[hidden]]
function to register variables, you must output those variables using
[[ehHiddenAndData]].  You must also manually code any HTML FORM that will
enclose your forms.
</p>
<p>There are likely to be other issues as well, but our own use of this
method is very limited so we cannot provide more comprehensive documentation
at this time.
</p>
<p>Generally speaking you will have to code much less if you use the
[[Universal Dispatch Method]].  Most of this documentation assumes that
you are using the Universal Dispatch Method.
