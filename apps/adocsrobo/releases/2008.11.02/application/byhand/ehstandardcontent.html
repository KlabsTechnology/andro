                            <p>boolean Output_title<br/><br/><br/>This is the grand-daddy function that must be in every template.
</p>
<p>During normal processing, control always passes to some instance of
[[x_table2]].  That object always echos HTML directly.  However, that
HTML is being buffered and is captured and saved.  This function
re-echos that HTML directly, plus it outputs all hidden variables
and various other essential goodies.
</p>
<p>Invoke this command in the main content area of your template.
