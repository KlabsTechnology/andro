All available keystrokes should be visible on the screen at all times.</P><P CLASS="Textbody">The x4 User Interface should allow any all tasks to be possible by mouse. </P><P CLASS="Textbody">The coloring of the elements on the screen must consistently portray their nature and behavior. Read-only controls should be colored differently than others. Primary keys should be colored differently. Clickable items should stand out in some way and have consistent mouseover effects.</P><P CLASS="Textbody">The x4 User Interface should never require the user to click or hit a key for an action that is going to happen anyway. So if a user hits a key in a search box the search should be executed instantly and the result displayed. As the user continues to type the search should be re-executed.</P><P CLASS="Textbody">The x4 User Interface should be context-intelligent. This means that if it knows a certain value on the screen is the primary key of a table, it should display that value as a link that will jump to the editing screen for that row.</P><P CLASS="Textbody">A user interface should be designed after the needs of human beings, not computers. </P><H2 CLASS="Heading2"><A NAME="Programmer_Goals"></A>Programmer Goals</H2><P CLASS="Textbody">Andromeda always seeks to eliminate tasks, it has no interest in merely managing tasks with conventions and to-do lists. If Andromeda can make a job go away forever then it will.</P><P CLASS="Textbody">Andromeda seeks to express everything in configuration files. We seek to avoid code at every turn.</P><P CLASS="Textbody">Andromeda seeks to provide “outs” for the programmer to enhance or replace the default framework behaviors. These should be provided wherever possible in all tiers of the application.</P><P CLASS="Textbody">If we can save a step by doing something unorthodox, we will always go the unorthodox route. But if there is no benefit to going unorthodox, then Andromeda goes the opposite route and attempts to be the “model citizen” in using common practices. Complete adherence to common practice makes Andromeda easier by giving programmers something they are used to. Consistent adherence to common practice reinforces the fact that any deviation from common practice is for some time-saving purpose.</P>
