<h1>Array Functions</h1>
                            
<p>
Array functions exist to supplement PHP's already impressive and
powerful array library.
</p>

<p>
Some functions here provide the general
Andromeda flavor to things, such as "ArraySafe" which provides the
Andromeda behavior of a [[Standard Default Value]].
</p>

<p>
Other functions provide the kind of handling you need for database
rows or data dictionary activities.
