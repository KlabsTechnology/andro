                            <p><br/><br/>This method is a hybrid static/dynamic method.
</p>
<p>In this method, every page gets its own PHP file, and each of these files
is in the public directory.  The top of each file will usually call out
to a "header" file and the bottom of each file will call out to a
"footer" file, hence the name of the method.  The header and footer files
together provide uniformity and consistency, while the actual contents
of each file contain the page-specific PHP and HTML.
</p>
<p>Andromeda does not do anything deliberately to prevent use of this
method, and even provides a feature that makes it easier to user, but there
is always more coding in this method than in the Universal Dispatch Method,
so as a general rule Andromeda does not use it.
