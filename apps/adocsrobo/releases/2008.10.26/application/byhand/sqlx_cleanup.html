                            <p>array Mixed_Rows<br/><br/><br/>A complete general cleanup of a mixed set of rows to ensure
that they will all insert ok.  This will smear over errors, such
as a value of '-' will become integer 0, strings will be
truncated, and so forth.
</p>
<p>There is no return value, the array is accepted by reference.
