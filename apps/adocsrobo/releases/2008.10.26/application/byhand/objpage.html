<p>If the class Page_Name exists inside of a file by the same name,
then that class is instantiated.
</p>
<p>If there is no file by the name of Page_Name, then an instance of
[[x_table2]] is instantiated and initialized for table Page_Name.
</p>
<p>If there is no table named Page_Name, an uninitialized instance of
[[x_table2]] is returned.
