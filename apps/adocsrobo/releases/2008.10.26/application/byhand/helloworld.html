<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>Andromeda aims to keep simple things simple and to make
   complicated things manageable.
   With that in mind, a basic Hello World! program is a very simple
   thing to do.  The following code snippet demonstrates this:
</p>

<pre><span class="syntax0"><span class="syntax17">&lt;?php</span> 
<span class="syntax8">class</span><span class="syntax8"> </span><span class="syntax11">x6helloworld</span><span class="syntax11"> </span><span class="syntax8">extends</span><span class="syntax11"> </span><span class="syntax11">androX6</span><span class="syntax11"> </span><span class="syntax18">{</span>
    <span class="syntax8">function</span> <span class="syntax6">x6main</span><span class="syntax18">(</span><span class="syntax18">)</span> <span class="syntax18">{</span>
        <span class="syntax17">?&gt;</span>
        Hello World!
        <span class="syntax17">&lt;?php</span>
    <span class="syntax18">}</span>
<span class="syntax18">}</span>
<span class="syntax17">?&gt;</span>
</span></pre>

<p>As we can see, every Andromeda page exists as a PHP file that has
   a class in it.  The class always extends the built-in class "androX6"
   (note the case, the "X" is uppercase the rest is lowercase).  The
   class itself is always named "x6" plus the name of the page:
</p>


<h4>x6 + {pageName} = x6helloworld</h4>

<p>This program should be saved in a file named "x6helloworld.php" in
   your application directory.  
</p>

<p>To see this page, go to your application, log in, and then type into
   the address bar "/path/to/app/index.php?x6page=helloworld".
</p>

<span class="warning">Linux file names are case-sensitive.  You must name
your file using the exact case that you provide to the x6page parameter.
</span>

<p>The x6main should send its HTML directly to output.  There is no
   need to worry about buffering, Andromeda takes care of that.
