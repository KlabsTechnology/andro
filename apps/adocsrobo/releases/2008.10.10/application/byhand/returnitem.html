            <h1>returnItem</h1>
                            
                            <p>string rettype<br/>string retname<br/>any value<br/><br/><br/>ANTICIPATORY DOCUMENTATION.  This entry documents features not
yet fully implemented.  I am currently working only on the
'data' portion for ajax returns.
</p>
<p>Use this function to store values that must be returned to the
browser.  This includes data, messages, and HTML snippets.
</p>
<p>The main purpose of this function is to have something you can
use for both regular page requests and for ajax requests.  The
idea is you keep registering the items to return, then they are
either fetched during HTML generation or sent back as JSON to
the browser, depending on how the request came in.  As programmers
all we have to know is that the data/message/snippet will get
where it belongs.
</p>
<p>The first parameter is the type.  We expect to be supporting
'data', 'message', and 'html'.  The second parameter is a name,
which varies according to the first parameter.
</p>
<p>If the first parameter is 'data', the second parameter is the name
of a table and the third paramter is a [[row]] array.  You can
call this function as often as needed for any number of tables,
it will accumulate the results.
</p>
<p>If the first parameter is 'message', the second parameter can
be either 'error' or 'info', and the third parameter should be
a string.
</p>
<p>If the first parameter is 'html', the second parameter should be
the ID of the html element, and the third parameter is the
innerHTML of that element.
</p>
