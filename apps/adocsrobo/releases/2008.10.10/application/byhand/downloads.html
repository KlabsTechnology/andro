<h1>Downloads</h1>
                            
<p>
Andromeda is available under the terms of the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>
</p>

<h1>Operating System Requirements</h1>

<p>
<b>Linux</b>:  Andromeda has been installed cleanly on Ubuntu Edgy and Gentoo.  
We have a separate page for [[Running on Linux]].
</p>

<p>
<b>Mac</b>: Andromeda can be installed and run on Mac OS X provided you follow 
particular instructions.  Our user reported using instructions  for Postgres 
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/opensource/postgres.html">here</a>
and for PHP <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/opensource/php.html">here</a>.
He also reported that <i>"I had to edit the httpd.conf file and comment
out the Apple PHP module lines and allow the Entrophy package
install lines to be the only active php module."</i>  This is apparently
because the default Mac PHP module is not configured for Postgres or
Mysql.
</p>

<p>
<b>Windows</b>: See our [[Running On Windows]] page for special information.
</p>

<h1>Required Packages</h1>

<p>
In short, Andromeda requires Apache, PHP, and Postgres, all of which are pretty easy to get going.
</p>

<p>
The pages [[Running on Windows]] and [[Running on Linux]] contain the detailed requirements.
</p>

<h1>Get Files From SourceForge</h1>

<p>
The latest Andromeda download files are always available on Sourceforge:

</p>

<p>
...then return here to continue the instructions.
</p>

<h1>Using the Browser-based Install</h1>

<p>
Here is what you do:
<ul>
<li>Follow the instructions in [[Running on Windows]] or [[Running on Linux]] to get your machine ready.
<li>Make a subdirectory of your web root named "andro_root"
<ul>
<li>On gentoo, the web root is /var/www/localhost/htdocs
<li>On Unbuntu, the web root is /var/www
<li>On a Windows machine with Xamp, the web root is X:\Program Files\xampp\htdocs.
</ul>
<li>Download the tarball to that directory and un-tarball it.
<li>Point your browser to <a href="http://localhost/andro_root/andro/">http://localhost/andro_root/andro/</a>
<li>Follow the instructions on-screen.
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Reported Problems</h1>

<p>
<b>Install Reverts to Step 1 after I complete Step 3</b>
</p>

<p>
This is caused by an error with sessions, so that Andromeda is
"forgetting" what step you are on.  Make sure that php.ini has
the setting "session.use_cookies = 1".
