                            <p>string Caption<br/>string href<br/><br/><br/>Returns a hyperlink that will invoke the javascript [[CheckFirst]] function
before executing the link. The [[CheckFirst]] function makes sure it is safe
to leave the current page, saving changes first and things like that.
</p>
<p>This function always builds links that explicitly go to index.php.
</p>
<p>There is no provision for specifying the class or id of the object
at this time.  It is expected that the hyperlink will get its styles
defined in descendant selectors.
