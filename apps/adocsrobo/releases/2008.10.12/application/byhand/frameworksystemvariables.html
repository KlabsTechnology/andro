<h1>Framework System Variables</h1>

<p>A "System Variable" is any value that affects an entire application.
   System variables are stored in a single table, called, aptly enough,
   VARIABLES.  Andromeda itself makes use of a handful of system
   variables, and any application can have any number of additional
   variables.
</p>

<p>There is no mechanism for avoiding naming collisions between your
   application variables and the framework variables, so please check
   this list before making use of a variable name.
</p>

<p>As of this writing, March 2007, Andromeda does not have a user 
   preferences system.  When it does, we will want user preferences
   to interact with system variables so that user preferences can
   override system variables.
</p>

<p>You can access the value of any system variable with the [[OptionGet]]
   function.
