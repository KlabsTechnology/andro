                            <p>string HTML_Caption<br/>array (HTML_Caption,HTML_Parm_Accesskey)<br/><br/><br/>Allows you to specify HMTL "Accesskey" for a hyperlink by putting a
backslash into the caption, so that "\Example" returns "<u>E</u>xample"
and 'accesskey="E"'.
</p>
<p>Accepts a string, examines the string for a backslash character.  If
one is found, it removes the backslash and underlines the character
immediately after.
</p>
<p>Returns the an array of two elements, first is the modified caption and
the next is an HTML fragment 'accesskey="X"' where 'X' is whatever character
was right after the backslash.
</p>
<p>If there is no backslash in the caption, then the caption is returned
unchanged and the accesskey is empty.
