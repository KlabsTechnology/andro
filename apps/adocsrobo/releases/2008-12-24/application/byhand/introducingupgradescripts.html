<h1>Introducing Upgrade Scripts</h1>

<p>Upgrade scripts are a new feature now available in Andromeda 
   that allow you to run snippets of code at the end of  
   upgrades.  
</p>

<p>Building databases is central to what Andromeda is all about.
   The build process was the first Andromeda program written, and
   is still the most important.  It creates tables, columns, indexes
   and triggers.  What the build program does not do is execute
   any kind of special actions you may need to move data around
   to populate new tables or columns.  That is where the scripts
   come in.
</p>

<p>Upgrade Scripts perform actions on the database after a build.
   Upgrade scripts are PHP programs
   that execute at superuser privelege and are especially useful for
   populating new columns with default values or populating a new
   table from data in old tables.
</p>

<p>There is a new documentation page for [[Upgrade Scripts]].
