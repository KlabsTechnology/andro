<p>
Returns a context variable.  A context variable is completely
specified by three levels, a Category, a Name, and a Key.
</p>

<p>
Context variables are specific to each window the user has open,
and remain alive as long as the user navigates with form POSTs.  When
the user navigates with an HTML hyperlink the context is lost.
</p>

<p>
Use this routine instead of [[ConGet]] to ensure your variables do not
collide with framework context variables.
</p>

<p>
The fourth parameter is a [[Standard Default Value]], which is returned
if the variable cannot be found.
