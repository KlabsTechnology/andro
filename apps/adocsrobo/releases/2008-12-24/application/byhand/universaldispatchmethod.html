            <h1>Universal Dispatch Method</h1>
                            
                            <p><br/><br/>This is the most purely dynamic way to build a web site.
In this system, there is only one
publicly visible file.  All requests from the browser go to this one
file, and the parameters of the request determine what code is called
to return HTML to the browser.
</p>
<p>Andromeda uses the Universal Dispatch Method by default (though  you
can also use the [[Header-Footer Method]]).  By convention a value is
always passed for 'gp_page' which corresponds to what page
the user has requested.  Under most circumstances the value for 'gp_page'
determines what class is instantiated and invoked.
</p>
<p>In Andromeda, the root file is <span class="nolink">index.php</span>, all requests from the
browser always go through this file.
</p>
<p>The only responsibility of <span class="nolink">index.php</span> is to save the values of the
directory it is in, and then pass control to [[index_hidden.php]].  All of
the main processing goes on in that file.  This program processes the
[[GET-POST Variables]], then it loads <span class="nolink">raxlib.php</span> and, if present,
[[applib.php]].
