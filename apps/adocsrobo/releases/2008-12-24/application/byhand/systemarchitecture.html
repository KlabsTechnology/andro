<h1>System Architecture</h1>

<p>Andromeda is <i>radically database oriented</i>.  The entire
   framework with its philosophy and approach is aimed at applications
   that have a database underneath them.  Our system architecture
   reflects this.  When it comes to the database, Andromeda has
   an approach that is not available anywhere else, and so naturally
   our database architecture does not always look like that of 
   other frameworks.  In the other layers,
   such as desktop, web server, or browser, we prefer to make use of
   the state of the art as supplied by others, but even there our
   code and its architecture is unmistakably affected by our 
   treatment of the database.

<h2>Diagram Zero</h2>

<p>The Andromeda approach takes it for granted that it is 
   <i>desirable and possible</i> to implement business rules inside
   of the database server.  Server-side business rules are
   desirable because they are 
   efficient and non-subvertible.  They are possible
   through the use of triggers, server-side security, and
   views.
</p>

<p>This means that in the Andromeda world our first diagram,
   which we call <b><i>Diagram Zero</i></b>, depicts how 
   the database relates to all other tiers:

<p>This is is the fundamental Andromeda architectural
   diagram, upon which all others are based.
