            <h1>Replacing The Default Template</h1>
                            
                            <p><br/><br/>Andromeda provides a default template suitable for database applications.
</p>
<p>For public sites you will certainly want to replace this completely with
something of your own design.  There are two simple ways to do this.
</p>
<h2>Method 1: html_main.php</h2>
<p>The default Andromeda template is provided by html_main.php, stored
in the [[lib directory]].  You can make up a new file, name it
html_main.php, and put it into the [[application directory]] and it will
override the version in the [[lib directory]].
</p>
<h2>Method 2: A New File</h2>
<p>You can make up your own template and save it in the <span class="nolink">application directroy</span>
with any name you want, though by convention we normally name templates
beginning with "html".
</p>
<p>Now you must make a setting to activate the use of your template file,
If your file is named 'html_replace.php', then in your [[applib.php]] file,
make this setting (note no trailing php extension):
</p>
<div class="box-php">vgaSet('html_main','html_replace');
</div>
<h2>What To Include In Your Template</h2>
<p>There are many things that should be in your template to make sure all
Andromeda features work. These include at this time:
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Link to raxlib.js
<li>Two code blocks to output dynamic CSS and dynamic script elements
<li>The main content
<li>Code blocks at bottom of file to output end-of-page script
</ul>
</p>
<p>We have elected not to attempt to detail all of these because they may
change during the transition from beta to first release.  The best way to
do this is to example html_main.php in the [[lib directory]] and copy the
dynamic elements into your own file.
</p>
