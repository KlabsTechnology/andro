                            <P CLASS="Textbody">The Andromeda x4 UI project focuses specifically on the browser and the web server code that supports it. Nevertheless, some review of the database is also in order, as so much of Andromeda's programming is determined by its implementation of business rules, security, and constraints in the server.</P><P CLASS="Textbody">The diagram below gives an outline of what Andromeda does in each tier</P><DIV CLASS="Textbody"><IMG WIDTH="721" HEIGHT="777" ALT="" SRC=".//x4arch.png" CLASS="fr1"></IMG></DIV><H2 CLASS="Heading2"><A NAME="The_Database"></A>The Database</H2><P CLASS="Textbody">An Andromeda database implements all business rules in the server itself, and all users connect to the database using real database accounts (instead of connecting with a generic over-privileged user.) For this reason, non-Andromeda client programs or power users can be given direct access to the database with no fear of violations of constraints, security, or calculation formulas.  For obvious reasons, direct access should only be given after a design has been well worked out and your team has high confidence that the security assignments reflect business needs.</P><P CLASS="Textbody">Clients connecting to an Andromeda database can use simple SQL to directly access tables. There is no need to go through a layer of stored procedures or anything like that. This is possible because business rules are implemented as triggers on tables.</P><P CLASS="P4">Andromeda is very unusual in the PHP world in that it not only allows direct database access, but it actually encourages it! This is made possible entirely because of our implementation of security in the server itself.</P><H2 CLASS="Heading2"><A NAME="The_Web_Server"></A>The Web Server </H2><P CLASS="Textbody">Andromeda's web server code is divided into two main branches. The original pre-x4 branch is a fairly conventional HTML generation and delivery system that uses a data dictionary to create editing forms. </P><P CLASS="Textbody">The x4 system makes several technical advances over the original branch:</P><UL ><LI CLASS="P5"><P CLASS="P5">Has far more keyboard shortcuts, which are also much more consistent with the feel of desktop applications.</P></LI><LI CLASS="P5"><P CLASS="P5">It is entirely AJAX-based, and is much snappier than the original.</P></LI><LI CLASS="P5"><P CLASS="P5">The x4 code never delivers HTML, but only page descriptions and query results.</P></LI></UL><P CLASS="Textbody">The x4 system still relies on the original branch for logins, menu setup, among other functions. The x4 system also generates page descriptions out of the Data Dictionary, exactly in the same way that the original branch generated HTML directly out of the Data Dictionary.</P><P CLASS="Textbody">The x4 system retains the ability to deliver HTML to the browser. In x4 terminology we now call this “replacement HTML.”</P><P CLASS="Textbody">With x4, the web server can now accept requests from any client that knows how to implement the page descriptions that the server returns. So in principle a GTK program could request a page description and build a desktop application, either on-the-fly or in a batch build operation.</P><H2 CLASS="Heading2"><A NAME="The_Browser"></A>The Browser</H2><P CLASS="Textbody">In x4 the browser is responsible for generating HTML elements and attaching event code to them. It does this based on the “page descriptions” that are returned by the web server. The browser implements all keystroke and mouse handling, and must cache query results from the server.</P><P CLASS="Textbody"></P>
