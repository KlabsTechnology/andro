            <h1>Processing Forms and Data</h1>
                            
                            <p><br/><br/>The Andromeda PHP framework exists solely to provide interfaces to
database data, so there are some behaviors built in to make it easy
to process HTML forms and to move data in and out of a database.
</p>
<p>You never need to make a connection to the database, Andromeda assumes
that if the user has made a request, it will most certainly involve
the database, and so Andromeda makes a connection before handing
control to the page.
</p>
<p>Likewise, you never actually need to output an HTML FORM in your
PHP pages, every page sent to the browser contains a form.
It always sends control back to <span class="nolink">index.php</span> under method "POST",
and is even setup to allow file
uploads.  You can see how it is created by examining the code of the
framework routine [[ehStandardOutput]] which is in <span class="nolink">raxlib.php</span>.
</p>
<p>There are a couple of javascript routines that can be called to submit
forms.  The simplest is "formSubmit()".  You can make any hyperlink call
"javascript:formSubmit()" and have it submit the form.  You can also
set the value of a form input and submit in one command, using the
command "SetAndPost(varname,varvalue)".  This is useful for having
"next" and "prev" buttons on wizards that say "SetAndPost('nav','next')".
</p>
<p>You can place hidden variables on the form by calling the API function
[[hidden]].  This function does not actually output any HTML, it registers
the value and then the HTML is output when the template is processed.
</p>
<p>For a wizard that covers several pages, you might output a hidden variable
that contains the current page, and another hidden variable that contains
an empty value.  Then put two buttons on the HTML that call respectively
"SetAndPost('nav','next')" and "SetAndPost('nav','prev')".  This makes
for nice general purpose code all around.
