<h1>Countdown to Release One</h1>
                            
<p><b>Updated: January 26, 2009</b></p>

<h2>The RoadMap</h2>

<p>In late December of 2008 we finished off all major work on the
   "x6" desktop-in-browser system, completing the original Andromeda
   vision.  Since that time we have been making the code IE compatible
   and working out bugs and adding any secondary features required
   by employers and clients of the core team.  
</p>

<p>Here is what remains before we can do Release 1:
</p>

<ol><li>Get our Debian package tested one more time and up onto  
    Sourceforge.
    <li>One more hack-a-thon (hopefully) to get the Windows installer
    finished up.
    <li>Continue purging old docs and make sure all features
        are documented.
    <li>Bug fixes.
    <li>"un-bork" the generated documentation.
</ol>

<p>Ken will be completing all secondary features for his customers in
   the next few days, and then it will be time for the feature freeze.
   <b><i>During the feature freeze, the only serious coding besides
         bug fixes will be performance issues that represent show-stoppers.
         Everything else must wait.</i></b>

<h2>After Release 1</h2>

<p>These are some of the major ideas that have been tossed around
   for the next release, in no particular order.
</p>

<ul><li>An x6 version of the Node Manager.  I wanted to get this into
        Release 1, but the Node Manager works fine as-is and we don't
        need to slow down the release by trying to stuff it in.
    <li>Support for mySQL or MS SQL Server
    <li>The ability to distribute free-standing apps that do not need
        a node manager.
    <li>A rewrite of the builder for speed and features.  The androBuild.php
        file is Ken's first serious program in PHP, the first code was 
        written 4 years ago.  On the plus side it is battle-proven and
        reliable, but on the down side it will be increasingly difficult
        to improve it w/o some significant refactoring.
    <li>More improvements to the demo and (maybe) additional demos.
    <li>Run the builder in "analzye" mode to show what changes would be
        done w/o actually doing them.
    <li>Major overhaul of the look and feel of the docs, they still look
        awful to Ken.
</ul>
