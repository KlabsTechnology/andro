            <h1>Modify A Table Page</h1>
                            
                            <p><br/><br/>Every table in an Andromeda database has a "page" that can be used to
directly access the data in the table.  We put the word "page" in quotes
because there is not actually a file on disk for each of these pages, they
are more like virtual pages that are handled by the file <span class="nolink">x_table2.php</span>.
Andromeda does not  need to have a file on disk for each table because
<span class="nolink">x_table2.php</span> uses the data dictionary to lay out the HTML for each
table.
</p>
<p>If you want to modify the default behavior of a Table Page in any
way, including providing a completely new look for it, you must begin
by putting a file into the [[application directory]].  It will contain
a class that has the same name as the table, which extends x_table2.  The
file itself will have the same name as the table.  All file names and
class names should be in lower case.
</p>
<div class="box-php">class customers extends x_table2 {
   function custom_construct() {
      // put customized construct information here
   }
   
   function main() {
      // if you override this method you will completely replace
      // standard processing.
   }
}
</div>
<p>If you have [[An Admin Interface for a Public Site]], then may want to
provide a custom display of the ITEMS table, but still allow administrators
to go into the ITEMS table to add, modify and delete items.
</p>
<p>The following code will accomplish this:
</p>
<div class="box-php">class items extends x_table2 {
   function main() {
      if(vgaGet('admin',false)==true) {
         // use default Andromeda table maintenance interface
         parent::main();
         return;
      } 
      else {
         $this->main_Public();   
      }
   }
}
</div>
<p> 
</p>
