                            <p>string FormName<br/>echos HTML<br/><br/><br/>This function outputs a standard HTML FORM open tag that will POST
results back to <span class="nolink">index.php</span>.  You will need to close the form manually
at then end of your content.  The name of the form should not be 'Form1',
as that will collide with the name of the standard form that is on all
pages.
</p>
<p>For all normal Andromeda pages you never need to output an HTML FORM, all
of your main output is always automatically wrapped in a form, and so you
would not normally need this function.
</p>
<p>You may need this function in cases where you have other forms on the page
that are outside of the main content, such as a login form that is always
sitting off on the left or something similar.
</p>
<p>This function is not meant to save a lot of typing, its purpose is to give
you an HTML FORM that is framework-consistent.  It also helps to avoid
the eternal problem of <span class="nolink">Messy HTML and PHP</span>.
