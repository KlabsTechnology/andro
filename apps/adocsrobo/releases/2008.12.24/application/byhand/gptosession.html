                            <p>framework<br/><br/><br/>This function saves all [[GET-POST Variables]] to the session for
later retrieval.  It saves them to the session variable "clean".
They can be retrieved by calling SessionGet('clean').
</p>
<p>This function is used by the framework when a user calls for a page
that requires a login.  This function caches the request until after
the user has logged in.
</p>
<p>There is no stack of user requests.  If this function is called twice
without retrieving the values, then the second call overwrites the
first.
</p>
<p>There is no function to retrieve the variables.  The framework
pulls them directly by calling SessionGet('clean').
