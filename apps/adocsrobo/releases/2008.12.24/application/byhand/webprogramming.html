<h1>Web Programming</h1>

<p>Web programming in Andromeda is meant to be flexible and powerful.
   Sometimes you need very simple pages that are best coded manually,
   other times you must paste in fragments of HTML prepared by a
   designer, and other times a page can be composed of pre-made
   Andromeda plugins.  These approaches can be mixed and matched in
   any way you like.
</p>

<p>Andromeda has some very powerful HTML classes that allow you to
   create very complex HTML without ever coding HTML, you just create
   objects and nest other objects inside them, setting properties as
   you go.  Whatever your style, Andromeda aims to stay out of the way
   when you do things your way, and to be helpful when you want to
   make use of the Andromeda tools.
