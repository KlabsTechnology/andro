<h1>TOOLTIPS</h1>

<p>This is a framework system variable that affects how the default
   framework generates tooltips.
</p>

<p>To begin, you can provide a tooltip to any column in any table by
   simply specifying the "tooltip" property of the column.  For any
   column that does not have this property set, Andromeda will generate
   a tooltip in very limited set of cases, notably if the [[AUTOMATION_ID]]
   is SEQUENCE, SUM, MIN or MAX.
</p>

<p>If the TOOLTIPS variable is not set or has the value "N", tooltips are
   placed to the right of the textboxes in the detail screen.
</p>

<p>If TOOLTIPS = "JQUERY_ALSO", then INPUT controls will get 
   hovering <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Tooltip"
   >JQuery Tooltips</a> in addition to the text placed at the right
   of the control.
</p>

<p>If TOOLTIPS = "JQUERY_ONLY", then INPUT controls will get the
   hovering tooltips and there will be no text placed out to the right
   of the controls.
</p>
