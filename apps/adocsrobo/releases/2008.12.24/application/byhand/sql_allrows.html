                            <p>string SQL_Command<br/>string Column_id<br/><br/><br/>Executes a SQL command and retrieves all rows into a [[Rows Array]].
</p>
<p>If the second parameter is provided, then the values of the named
column are made into the keys for the rows in the result.
</p>
<p>Extreme care should be taken with this command.  Experience has shown
that PHP's performance drops dramatically with the size of the result
set, so much so that anything over 100 rows or so should probably not
be contemplated for this command.
