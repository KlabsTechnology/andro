<h1>Create a non-Table Page</h1>
                            
<p>
Besides modifying Table pages, you can also provide pages that are not
directly associated with a table.
</p>

<p>
First, create a file in your [[application directory]] that has the same
name as the page.  Have it contain a class that has the same name as your
page that extends x_table2, like so:
</p>

<div class="box-php">class not_a_table_page extends x_table2 {
   function main() {
      // this is where it all happens
   }
}
</div>

<p>
However, users will not be able to see this by default because
Andromeda is meant to be secure by default.  Unless users are given
permission to see something, it is assumed they are not allowed.
</p>

<p>
To make the new page "public" so that anybody can see it, make sure
that your [[applib.php]] file populates an array named $MPPages, and
make an entry in that array where the key is the name of the table
and the value is a description:
</p>

<div class="box-php">$MPPAGES=array(
   'not_a_table_page'=>'Page Description'
);
</div>
