<h1>Database Reference</h1>
                            
<p>
This section lists all of the elements and their properties that
can be defined in an Andromeda database.
</p>

<p>
Some of these elements will make sense to anybody who has built a
database, such as [[table]] and [[column]] and [[table.index]], while others
are unique to Andromeda, such as [[table.column.chain]].
