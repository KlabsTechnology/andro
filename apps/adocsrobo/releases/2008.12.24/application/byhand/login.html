            <h1>login</h1>
                        <p>string USER_ID<br/>string PASSWORD<br/><br/><br/>This is an experimental routine.
</p>
<p>This routine is used by public websites that accept user registration
information.  The idea is that after you create their account you call
this routine to log them in, saving them the annoyance of having to
re-type their username/password at a login screen.
