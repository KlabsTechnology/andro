<h1>Web Architecture Overview</h1>

<p>When you write a small desktop application that opens up
   local files you have a <i>single-tier</i> application.  That
   is to say that your application does not have to connect
   to any servers to obtain anything, it just opens up its local
   files and does its thing.  These applications are also
   called monolithic.  Once upon a time this was the only
   kind of application there was.
</p>

<p>A browser that is reading static pages from a web server
   is a two-tier system, also known as a client/server system.
   In order for the browser to perform a useful function
   it must connect to a server and obtain something to work
   with.  Other two-tier systems include desktop applications
   that connect to database servers, of which a great many
   were written in the 90s. 
</p>

<p>Finally, a browser connecting to a web server that then
   connects to a database server is a 3-tier system.  These
   are all of the rage since the turn of the century.

<h2>Andromeda and The Web Application</h2>

<p>The complete Andromeda framework is a 3-tier system,  
   which means it is used to write web applications.
   The Andromeda framework is very different from most
   other frameworks because of its unique treatment of
   business rules.
</p>

<p>Andromeda implements all business rules in the database
   server, relieving the programmer of the need to fashion
   application code in the web layer.  Without this web layer
   code, Andromeda suddenly has few comparison points with
   other frameworks.
</p>

<p>In fact, the Andromeda view of the web layer is that it is
   a "traffic cop" or "waiter".  The "waiter" analogy is
   as follows.  The web server (waiter), gets a request
   from the user and converts it to one or more SQL
   commands, just as a waiter brings orders to the
   kitchen.  Then the web server converts the results to HTML
   and returns it to the browser, just as a waiter brings the
   food to the table.  This is depicted here:
