<h1>Constraints</h1>
                            
<P>
There are two basic kinds of constraints. They are thoroughly explained in the reference section and will not be discussed in great detail here, except as an introduction.

<H2><A NAME="Column_Values"></A>Column Values</H2>

<P>
A constraint can be placed on any column. In terms of syntax it looks exactly like a calculated value (like extended price in a previous section). The big difference is the return value. If a constraint returns an empty string, the constraint is considered to have not fired, and the transaction is allowed to continue. If the constraint returns a string, the constraint is considered to have failed, and the string is expected to be an error message.

<H2 CLASS="Heading2"><A NAME="Preventing_Changing_Rows"></A>Preventing Changing Rows</H2>

<P>
It is possible to put constraints onto tables that will prevent rows from being changed, such as after a <q>closed</q> has been set. These are useful if you want to prevent changes to a GL batch after it has been balanced and posted.
