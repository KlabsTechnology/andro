                            <p>string type_id<br/>string name <br/>string value (optional)<br/><br/><br/>This function is new as of 3/9/07, and not yet fully populated.  At the
time of its creation, all widget generation is in [[ahInputsComprehensive]],
with no ability to generate individual widgets as needed.  This will be
added to as needed to supply the various types.
</p>
<p>If the type_id is cbool, then the HTML "value" property is always Y, and
the third parameter is taken to be the caption.
