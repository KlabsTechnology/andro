                            <p>string Column_ID<br/>string SQL_Command<br/><br/><br/>Accepts and executes a SQL command on the current default connection.
It then fetches the first row of the result, and if it can find the
named column, returns its value.
</p>
<p>Any failure at any stage returns false.
</p>
<p>Be careful that the SQL_Command actually return one or at most a few
rows, if a command is issued to the server that would return 1 million
rows, the server will execute the entire command, even though it only
returns the first row to PHP.
