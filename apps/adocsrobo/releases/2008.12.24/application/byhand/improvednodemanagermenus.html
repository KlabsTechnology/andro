<h1>Improved Node Manager Menus</h1>

<p>February 6, 2008</p>

<p>As part of our effort to improve the experience of new Andromeda 
   programmers, we have reorganized the menu so it makes more sense
   operationally.  The previous menu grouped together tasks without
   any indication of their priority or frequency of use.  The new
   menu puts the most used items first and groups like items
   together.
</p>

<p>The main menu pad is now called "Applications" instead of
   "Operations" and this is where you create and build Andromeda
   applications and instances.  This is also where you pull published
   versions of your applications to your servers from
   your SVN repositories.
</p>

<p>The second menu pad is "This Node".  This is where you set up
   "Local Web Directories", which are the directories where your
   applications are built.  You also create Node Superusers here
</p>

<p>The third pad is "Source Control", which contains Andromeda's
   deprecated built-in source control functions.
</p>

<p>If you do not see these menu items this way, go to the 
   "Operations: applications", and pick out "andro".  Go to the
   detail page and change the spec file from "andro" to "andro.dd.yaml"
   and then rebuild.  Then log out and log in and you will see the
   new menu.
</p>
