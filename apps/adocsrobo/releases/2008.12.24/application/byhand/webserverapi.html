<h1>Web Server API</h1>

<span class="info">This documentation section is going 
   to eventually contain a cleaned-up version of the
   current [[Framework API Reference]] section.  These
   two sections will contain overlap during that period,
   and eventually the old section will be removed.

<p>Andromeda provides a library of functions for use in
   your PHP programs.  They are divided into a dozen or so
   sub-libraries.  Each library covers a particular kind
   of service, such as data dictionary functions, GET/POST
   variables, Session variables, and so forth.
</p>

<P>Andromeda does not provide replacement or wrapper 
   functions for native PHP features unless there is some
   clear advantage to be gained.    If you do not see something
   you need here, you can probably just use the native
   PHP function.  If you see something here that appears very
   basic, the Andromeda version probably has a twist that
   mostly likely will make for less code.
