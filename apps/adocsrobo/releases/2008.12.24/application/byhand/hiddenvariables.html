            <h1>Hidden Variables</h1>
                            
                            <p><br/><br/>Hidden variables are the simplest and most time-honoured way to
send data to the browser that will come back on the next form post.

<p>Andromeda allows you to "register" hidden variables at any time
using the function [[Hidden]].  The framework function
[[ehHiddenAndData]] then outputs them when the HTML is being
generated.
