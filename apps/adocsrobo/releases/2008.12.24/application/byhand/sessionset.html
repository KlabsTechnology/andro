                            <p>string Var_Name<br/>any Var_Value<br/>any<br/><br/><br/>This program sets a session variable.  The variable will exist
as long as the PHP session is alive.
</p>
<p>The framework tracks only 2 session variables.  These are UID, which
is user_id, and PWD, which is user password.  An application must be
careful not to overwrite those values, as the framework will make no
provision to prevent such an accident.
