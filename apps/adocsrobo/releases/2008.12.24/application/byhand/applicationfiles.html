<h1>Application Files</h1>
                            
<p>
Application files are those that you create and put into the
[[application directory]].  This directory is always empty for a
new application, the framework never places anything here.
</p>

<p>
It is possible, though rare, to have an Andromeda application that
requires no application files.  This is the case usually when the
application uses the standard interface exclusively and has no
special imports or exports.
