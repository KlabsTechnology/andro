                            <p>array Rows<br/>array TableRows<br/><br/><br/>Accepts a [[Rows Array]] and returns a [[TableRows]] array.  None of the
cells of the [[TableRows]] array will have a class assignment.  This is
very important, as some routines such as [[TableRowsClassAlternate]] will
not override an existing class assignment.  Because of those routines that
do not override an existing class assignment, this routine makes no class
assignment.
</p>
<p>This routine is normally used for body data, not for the row of header
cells.
