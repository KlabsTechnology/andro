<h1>New Website For 2008</h1>

<p>I am very happy to announce that there are lot of big changes
   coming to Andromeda in the next few weeks.  To kick them off
   and set the tone, we have a new web site design.  The new
   web site will be much easier to keep up-to-date and I hope you
   will see a lot more docs and news articles here.
</p>

<p>The original website was designed to resemble the 
   <a href="http://www.secdat.com">Secure Data Software, Inc. 
   website</a>, since at that time the overlap between
   the two was very high.  Happily we now have non-SDS 
   contributors to Andromeda, and so it is time for Andromeda
   to get a look that is independent.</p>
   
<p>If you are the creative type and want to help, don't hesitate
   to offer.  In particular we do not want to stick with the 
   current logo very long.  We want to find one that is simple and
   stylish but a little more exciting than the one you see now.
</p>

<p>Every effort has been made to keep all links compatible between
   old and new, so search engine hits that come to the new site
   should all work. 
</p>
   
<p>The website can also be retrieved to your local directory
   with wget, which was not possible with the old one (the lack
   of ".html" at the end of the urls made it troublesome).
   This was requested by a new Andromeda programmer here on 
   Long Island who is often in places where there is no internet,
   and he wanted to be able to peruse the documentation.
