<h1>JS_CSS_DEBUG</h1>

<p>This system variable controls whether or not CSS and JS files are
   combined and minified.  It applies to all CSS and JS files that are
   registered with [[cssInclude]] and [[jsInclude]].
</p>

<p>If your application makes use of CSS and JS files that are not part
   of Andromeda, it is best to "register" them by use of the [[cssInclude]]
   and [[jsInclude]] functions.  These functions can be put anywhere in
   your code.  They take a <i>relative</i> path to the files and should
   never include anything like "http://" or "~/kfd/" or the domain name.
   A typical example would be:
</p>

<pre><span class="syntax0"><span class="syntax17">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="syntax6">jsInclude</span><span class="syntax18">(</span><span class="syntax13">'</span><span class="syntax13">appclib/jquery.example.js</span><span class="syntax13">'</span><span class="syntax18">)</span><span class="syntax18">;</span>
<span class="syntax6">cssInclude</span><span class="syntax18">(</span><span class="syntax13">'</span><span class="syntax13">appclib/jquery.example.css</span><span class="syntax13">'</span><span class="syntax18">)</span><span class="syntax18">;</span>
<span class="syntax17">?&gt;</span>
</span></pre>

<p>In order to provide the best performance and user experience, Andromeda
   outputs the necessary LINK and SCRIPT tags in the HEAD for CSS files
   and at the bottom of the page for SCRIPT files.
</p>

<p>If the JS_CSS_DEBUG system variable is missing or set to N, which is the
   default for a server, all CSS files are combined into a single file and
   delivered to the browser as such, which reduces the number of HTTP 
   calls to the server.  Likewise, the JS files are combined and are also
   minified.  This process occurs only once for each particular combination
   of files, and the resulting file is saved and used for all subsequent
   requests until it is cleared by a build.
</p>

<p>I the JS_CSS_DEBUG system variable is set to Y, neither CSS nor JS
   files are combined, nor is the JS minified.  This is the preferred setting
   when you are debugging, and is more common on development workstations.
</p>
