            <h1>Simple HTML Generation</h1>
                            
                            <p><br/><br/>Andromeda contains a very large number of routines that generate
simple snippets of HTML.  The real purpose of these routines is to
avoid messy mixtures of HTML and PHP, mixtures that are difficult
to write and very difficult to maintain.
