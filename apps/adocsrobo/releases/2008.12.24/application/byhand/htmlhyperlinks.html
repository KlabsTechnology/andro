                            <p><br/><br/>The Andromeda PHP framework provides a few functions for generating
hyperlinks easily.  Their main purpose is to provide consistency.
</p>
<p>All of these functions begin with the letter 'h' and return a snippet
of HTML that can be embedded into an HTML stream.
</p>
<p>All of these functions take as a first parameter an optional class
assignment.
