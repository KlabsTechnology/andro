<h1>Countdown to Release One</h1>
                            

<h2>The RoadMap</h2>

<p>As of April 2008 there is only one major feature of
   Andromeda that is still under development, which is
   the "Extended Desktop" user interface, which we called
   "x4" in earlier documents.  When this interface is
   is finished we will have completed all major elements
   of Andromeda and it will be time to finish off the
   documentation, clean up the code, and start to 
   consider making a public Release one. 
</p>

<p>The list below details the items we have been
   tracking in our countdown to release one.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>New Website (Complete Fall 2007).</b>  The new website makes
    it easier to keep the docs up-to-date, 
    especially pages like this one.
<li><b>Adopt SVN Source Control (Complete Jan 2008)</b>.  We are now
    using SVN for Andromeda itself, and will no longer use
    Andromeda's built in source control.
<li><b>Adopt SVN for publishing and upgrades (Complete Feb 2008).</b>
    We need 
    to modify Andromeda's application updating process to
    pull from SVN instead of its own deprecated source
    control system.
<li><b>Documentation: All Guides and Walk-throughs.</b>  There should
    be simple and concise guides to all of Andromeda's features.
<li><b>Documentation: Reference</b>.  All reference docs need to be
    updated and completed.  Any omissions need to be filled in.
<li><b>Documentation: Purge</b>  The documentation contains many 
    pages, notably in the API reference, documenting functions that
    are going to be tossed out.
<li><b>Code Cleanup</b>.  Any lingering inconsistencies in file
    naming, function naming, and so on should be cleaned up.
<li><b>Code Purge</b>.  A very large portion of androLib.php will
    be moved over to androLibDeprecated.php.  This library will be
    available for backward compatibility, but will not be loaded by
    default by the framework.  
<li><b>Explicit Install Instructions For All Major Platforms. (Partially
    Complete)</b>.  There should be very explicit instructions on 
    installing on all major platforms including separate details for
    servers and workstations, Linux and Windows.
</ul>

<h2>After Release One</h2>

<p>The items below were under consideration for Release one
   originally, but all of them represent modifications of
   existing functionality.  Release one will be the
   reference implementation of Andromeda concepts, and the
   items listed below will be enhancements to that
   reference implementation.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>MYSQL Hackathon</b>.  This is the big one, we want
    Andromeda to use MySQL.  There is a special entry on
    this below.
<li><b>Go To Components Model</b>.  Right now Andromeda is
    monolithic.  We want to break it up into components,
    like the builder, the x4 interface, one or more
    various security packages, and so on.
<li><b>Eliminate Node Manager</b>.  The Node Manager is a
    relic of the environment Ken was in when he dreamed
    up Andromeda.  Experience has shown it gets in the way
    more than it helps.  
<li><b>Installation Packages</b>.  Now that the installer has
    been debugged and is known to be pretty strong, we want
    to have a debian package and a windows installer.
</ul>

<h2>The MySQL Hackathon</h2>

<p>After Release One, we want to do a Hackathon 
   to get MySQL Support built into Andromeda.  After that it
   will support both Postgres and MySQL.  For more information
   join our <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/andro-general">mailing list</a>
   and join in the discussion.

<h2>Major Components</h2>

<p>Once we have broken Andromeda up into components, the
   conversation about Release 1 is really about which
   components will go into it and how to make them
   ready.  The draft list of components is here:
</p>
   
<table class="chart">
<thead>
  <th>Component
  <th>Status
  <th>Description
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr><td>Builder</td>
    <td>n/a
    <td>This component would fetch code from published
        sources and build/upgrade databases.  Not interactive.
<tr><td>Users</td>
    <td>n/a
    <td>A component that maintains users.
<tr><td>Passwords</td>
    <td>n/a
    <td>Contains special code for secure retrieval and
        setting of passwords.
<tr><td>Classic API</td>
    <td>n/a
    <td>This will be a catch-all component that will have all
        of the original Andromeda API available so that old
        applications do not break.
<tr><td>x4 User Interface</td>
    <td>n/a
    <td>A desktop-in-a-browser interface that uses javascript
        to give a super-fast keyboard-driven experience
        to people who actually have to type all day.
<tr><td>x2 "Classic" Interface</td>
    <td>n/a
    <td>The current HTML/PHP based user interface for
        Andromeda, centered around the class x_table2.
<tr><td>androPage</td>
    <td>n/a
    <td>A really nifty new component that we started in January 2008
        that lets you make YAML files that describe queries, which
        can then be output to PDF or using Smarty to the screen.
        Cool!
<tr><td>Plugins</td>
    <td>n/a
    <td>A facility for easily plugging in UI components like
        RSS feeds, Google maps and so forth.
