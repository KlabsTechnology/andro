            <h1>Specialized SQL Commands</h1>
                            
                            <p><br/><br/>Specialized SQL commands allow you to use a single command for
many common tasks that would otherwise take several commands.  The
routine [[SQL_OneValue]] for instance executes a query and pulls a single
column out of the first row and returns it.
</p>
<p>Some specialized SQL commands are also dictionary-aware, so that the
command [[SQLX_UpdateOrInsert]] will try to find a row based on the table's
primary key, and will also only issue commands for columns that it
recognizes.
</p>
<p>Generous use of Specialized SQL Commands is one of the ways to make
the most of Andromeda, there is a command for most any common operation
you want to perform.
