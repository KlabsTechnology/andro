            <h1>Pages, Classes, and Tables</h1>
                        <p><br/><br/>A regular Andromeda application will display a menu entry for each
table that the user is allowed to see.  If there are no special visual
requirements, there will be no program code at all, the Andromeda libraries
will create all of the HTML "for free".  In
the case of these tables we can talk about "the orders page" and we mean
"the page where the user sees entries in the ORDERS table".
In these cases we
do not mean "a class file containing code relating to the ORDERS table"
because that class file does not exist.
</p>
<p>Sometimes we have special programs, such as a rapid data entry screen,
which do not correspond to a database table.  For these you must have a
PHP class file in the [[application directory]].
