                            <p>string/array table<br/>array Row<br/><br/><br/>In its most basic form, this routine accepts a [[Row Array]]
and attempts to update that row in the table.
</p>
<p>The first entry can be either a <span class="nolink">Table Reference</span> or the name of
a table.  The second entry is always a [[Row Array]].  This function
makes use of the dictionary to determine the correct formatting of all
columns, and ignores any column in the [[Row Array]] that is not
in the table.
