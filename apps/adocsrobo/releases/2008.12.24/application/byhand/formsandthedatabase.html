            <h1>Forms And The Database</h1>
                            
                            <p><br/><br/>The Andromeda default interface provides browse lists and input forms for
displaying data that comes from a database.  All of the code that does this
is in <span class="nolink">x_table2.php</span> or <span class="nolink">raxlib.php</span>, and you can use the same code
on specialty pages to do similar effects.
</p>
<p>For instance, consider the case where you wish to display a user's
profile information on a form, using boxes that are appropriate to the
size, type, and so forth of the data.  This will do the trick:
</p>
<div class="box-php">class users extends x_table2 {
   
   function main() {
      $uid=SessionGet('UID');
      
      $this->row=SQL_OneRow(
         "Select * FROM users where user_id='$uid'"
      );
      echo $this->hBoxesFromProjection('upd','default');
   }
}
</div>
<p>That routine will generate HTML captions and inputs for all of the
columns in the database that would normally be visible.  Likewise it
will populate them with values from "$this->row".
</p>
<p>When the user posts the form, the changes will automatically be saved!
</p>
<p>The framework looks for inputs generated by this library routine and
saves them if they have changed.
</p>
