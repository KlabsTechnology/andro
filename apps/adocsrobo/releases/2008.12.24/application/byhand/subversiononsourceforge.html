<H1>Subversion on Sourceforge</h1>

<p>Last night, January 22, 2008, Justin Dearing (user j-pimp) 
   took the current latest code and committed it to our 
   subversion repository, and from now on the Sourceforge 
   subversion repository is the official authoritative 
   repository for the Andromeda project.
</p>

<p>Prior to this time, Andromeda had its own plain-vanilla
   source control, which was part of Andromeda's overall
   enterprise-level strategy of being able to completely 
   track projects from coding to delivery and subsequent
   maintenance.  From here forward we will let Subversion
   to the hard work in terms of source control, so that we
   can put our efforts into Andromeda's abilities to pull
   subversion repositories as local upgrades or for packaging.
</p>

<p>Justin Dearing joined the project right about the same time as
   Donald Organ, bringing the Andromeda team to 3 and 
   expanding it beyond the original company that founded it,
   Secure Data Software, Inc.
