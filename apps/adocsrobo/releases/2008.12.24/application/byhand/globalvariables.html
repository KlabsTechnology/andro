            <h1>Global Variables</h1>
                            
                            <p><br/><br/>Andromeda provides some wrapper functions for getting and setting
framework variables.  The main purpose of these is to allow your
application to create variables without worrying about name collisions
with framework global variables.
</p>
<p>A global variable is one that exists from the beginning to the end of
a server request.  Once the HTML has been delivered to the browser, the
globals are all gone.  If you need to store variables that are
persistent from request to request, consider using [[Context Variables]].
</p>
<p>You can set a Global Variable with [[vgaSet]] and
retrieve it with [[vgaGet]].
</p>
<p>These values can be any valid PHP type.
</p>
<p>The framework uses the corresponding functions [[vgfSet]] and
[[vgfGet]].
</p>
