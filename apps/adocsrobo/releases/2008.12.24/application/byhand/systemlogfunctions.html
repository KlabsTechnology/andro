            <h1>System Log Functions</h1>
                            
                            <p><br/><br/>System Log functions are used when you must be certain that a log
entry will be written, even if the current transaction rolls back.
These kinds of logs are intended for use in debugging or tracking
invisible processes, such as a Paypal IPN transaction.
</p>
<p>A log can be opened with [[SysLogOpen]], which returns a handle to
the log.  Log entries are made with [[SysLogEntry]] and the log is
eventually closed with [[SysLogClose]].
</p>
<p>The logs are stored in tables [[syslogs]] and [[syslogs_e]].
</p>
<p>The guarantee that the log entry will always be written comes at the
price of a separate connection to the database for each log.  In a
debugging situation you can open as many of them as you need, but in
a production system they should only be used in highest need.
