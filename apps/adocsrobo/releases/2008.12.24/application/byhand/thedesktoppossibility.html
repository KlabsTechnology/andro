<h1>The Desktop Possibility</h1>

<p>Andromeda does not at this time provide desktop 
   applications.  However, Andromeda has a unique flexibility
   that makes it possible to imagine deploying existing
   admin interfaces on the desktop with little or no 
   re-coding.
</p>

<h2>The Admin Screens</h2>

<p>In a working Andromeda application, all of the business
   rules are implemented inside of the database server.
   The framework provides 'free' administration screens
   for entering data, but those screens themselves are
   generated only by reading the data dictionary and
   creating tables and inputs that reflect that 
   data dictionary.  No business rules are actually
   enforced in these free screens.
</p>

<p>It is easy to see that desktop admin screens could
   be generated for gtk or .Net just as easily 
   as they are generated for web pages, since these
   screens do not bear the burden of enforcing business
   rules.
</p>

<h2>The androPage Factor</h2>
   
<p>The powerful [[androPage]] system allows programmers
   to produce reports, inquiries and general displays 
   without actually writing any code.  The framework
   generates the pages and outputs with the same type
   of methods used for the admin screens.
</p>

<p>Therefore, in any case where a program is composed
   entirely of a database and androPages, then it could be
   redeployed to the desktop with zero coding.
   
   
<h2>Custom Displays</h2>

<p>Different display methods have their various strengths
   and weaknesses.  Desktop applications have advantages
   that browsers cannot match and vice-versa.  
</p>

<p>Therefore it stands to reason that a quality web 
   application will have custom pages that simply cannot
   be presented on a desktop without recoding for the
   desktop format.  If an Andromeda programmer wants
   to deploy on both desktop and browser, the custom
   displays will likely consume most of the duplicate
   efforts.
</p>

    
<h2>Other Comments</h2>

<p>Andromeda implements design ideas that make it
   uniquely suited to deploy applications simultaneously
   on both desktop and web without duplicating business
   code.  At this time we have no serious plans to
   attempt this, but the idea is discussed from time
   to time.
