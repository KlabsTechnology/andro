                            <p>echo<br/> <br/>Displays a notice that says "This page is waiting for design".  Intended<br/>to be used during development for pages that must be viewable by staff<br/>and clients, but which have not been layed out yet by a designer.  Usually<br/>a page like this will have plain-vanilla dumps of details from a database,<br/>so that a designer knows what must appear on the final page.<br/><br/><br/>The notice is put into a DIV block of class "devnotice".  That class
is defined in the appropriate CSS skin file (default: <span class="nolink">skin_tc.css</span>).
