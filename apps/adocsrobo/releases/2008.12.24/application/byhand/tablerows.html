            <h1>TableRows</h1>
                            
                            <p><br/><br/>These are data that has been structured so that HTML styles can easily
be applied for later rendering.
</p>
<p>The basic idea is to pull some data from a database, convert it into
TableRows using something like [[TableRowsFromRows]], and then use
any number of style-applying functions like [[TableRowsSetColumnClass]]
or [[TableRowsClassAlternate]] to set CSS classes of rows and columns,
and finally to render with [[hTableRowsRender]].
