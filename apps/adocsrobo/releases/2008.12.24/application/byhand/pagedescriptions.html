                            <P CLASS="Textbody">When a page description is returned the browser looks to the top element for its type and calls the respective code to draw that top element in the main content area. Then, depending on the type, it recurses the child elements doing the same thing. This repeats until the entire tree of elements has been traversed.</P><H2 CLASS="Heading2"><A NAME="HTML_Elements"></A>HTML Elements</H2><P CLASS="Textbody">Any HTML element can be returned to the browser, though the framework itself only sends TABLE, TR, and TD elements. The browser attempts to recurse all HTML elements regardless of the tag. </P><P CLASS="P4">Note: it might be argued that using HTML elements breaks the abilities of other kinds of clients, like a GTK program, to make use of the page descriptions. However, if we limit ourselves to the simple elements of TABLE-related elements and perhaps DIV, then these should easily translate into analogous elements in other systems.</P><H2 CLASS="Heading2"><A NAME="Framework_Page_Elements"></A>Framework Page Elements</H2><P CLASS="Textbody">Each framework page element has some specific behavior, and they are mostly analogous to desktop GUI elements like the tabbar, data grid, and so forth. The bulk of the programming on the x4 system so far has been to define and code the framework elements. The framework elements are discussed in the next chapter.</P>
