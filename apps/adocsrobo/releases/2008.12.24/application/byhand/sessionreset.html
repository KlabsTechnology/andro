                            <p>void<br/><br/><br/>Destroys all session variables for the current application.  We use this
instead of PHP session_destroy because it allows a user to be logged in
to several apps at once, because the framework makes effective sessions
for each separate application.
</p>
<p>Note that this function destroys both application and framework session
variables, there is more information on what these are on the
[[Session Variables]] page.
