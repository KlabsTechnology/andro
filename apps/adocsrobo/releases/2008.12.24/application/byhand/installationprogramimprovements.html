<h1>Installation Program Improvements</h1>

<p>February 5, 2008</p>

<p>Great software begins with a great installation.  At the same
   time, bad software begins <i>and ends</i> with a bad
   installation experience.  For some time the Andromeda team has
   been aware that certain small but significant bugs existed in
   the Andromeda installer that were probably bringing many downloads
   to a short end. 
</p>

<p>We are happy to announce that we have fixed two major glitches 
   in the installation process and we hope to see a much smoother
   experience going forward.  The reference installation was done
   on Ubuntu 7.10 and we were able to obtain flawless installs.
</p>

<p>Our approach was to use VMWare running an instance of Ubuntu
   7.10.  We took at "snapshot" of the virtual machine right after
   installation of Ubunut, and then ran the installation several
   times from the start until we had found two major bugs and 
   smoothed out various other kinks and wrinkles.  The result we
   hope is a much smoother installation.
