<h1>applib.php</h1>
                            
<p>
This file does not exist unless you create it and put it into the
[[application directory]].
</p>

<p>
This file is invoked on every trip to the server, so anything that you
need on every trip should be put here, but care should be taken to avoid
unnecessary processing in this file.
</p>

<p>
This file serves two purposes.  First, the code at the top of the file
is executed on every request to the server.  Therefore the top of the file
is a good place to put settings and tests.  Second, the file can contain
library functions that you wish to be globally available to any other
file in your application.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of an applib file that makes some settings and
has a function available:
</p>

<div class="box-php">
vgaSet('setting1','This setting always happens for every page');
// set a page if none was requested
if(gp('gp_page')=='') { 
   gpSet('gp_page','p_home');
}

// This function is available to every page in the system, it
// provides a date format that we use everywhere
function PreferredDateFormat($unix_ts) {
   return date('...',$unix_ts);
}
</div>
