successfull, the currently open default connection, if there is one,
is pushed onto a stack, and this connection becomes the new default.

<p>The connection is closed with [[SQL_ConnPop]].

<p>If the first parameter is 'ADMIN', then the connection is made as the
superuser, otherwise the connection is always made as the username
retrieved by the [[SessionGet]] function for the variable "UID".
