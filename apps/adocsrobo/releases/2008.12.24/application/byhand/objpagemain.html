                            <p>string PHP_Class<br/>echos HTML<br/><br/><br/>This routine will accept the name of a class, instantiates an object,
and call's the object's "main" method.  In Andromeda, the "main"
method always outputs HTML.
</p>
<p>This is a handy way to "redirect" from one page to another.  If
execution has passed to Page1.main, and the code determines that
execution must go to Page2.main, then you can issue
</p>
<div class="PHP">objPageMain('Page2');
</div>
<p>This routine will <b>not</b> wipe out HTML that has been output before it
is called.  To avoid the HTML from one page appearing on the next,
be sure to call this routine before HTML has been generated.
