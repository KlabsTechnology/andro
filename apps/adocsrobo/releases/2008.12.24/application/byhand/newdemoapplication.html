<h1>New Demo Application</h1>

<p>Andromeda now has a new demonstration program, located at
   <a href="http://www.andromeda-project.org/demo"
   >http://www.andromeda-project.org/demo</a>.
</p>

<p>The demonstration program is long overdue, and will serve many purposes.
   Besides the obvious ability of users to see and feel the program,
   it contains other features such as displays of source code,
   demo data, and fully priveleged demo account that users can use to
   do basically anything they want.
</p>

<p>A big focus for Ken right now is x4, so we can expect to see 
   x4 features showing up in the demo.
</p>

<p>This will be the only demonstration system for Andromeda for the
   foreseeable future.  We want to see as many features as possible working
   in this system.
