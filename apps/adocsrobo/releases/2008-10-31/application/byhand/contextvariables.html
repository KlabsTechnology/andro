<h1>Context Variables</h1>
                            
<p>
Andromeda provides Context Functions as a more robust and flexible
alternative to [[Session Variables]].
</p>

<p>
A "context" is all of the state that is specific to a particular
browser tab.  If a user opens three browser windows
to your app, and three tabs in each browser, each of the nine tabs will
have its own context.
</p>

<p>
The context is returned to the server only when the user navigates by
POST.  If you need to use context, make sure you are using SUBMITs and
not hyperlinks.
</p>

<p>
[[Session Variables]] are stored on the server, but Context Variables
are sent out to the browser and then returned with each round trip.
This means that care must be taken only to add the most essential
information to context.
</p>

<p>
The Andromeda framework sometimes writes its own context variables.  You
can avoid collisions with these variables by always using the functions
whose names begin with "app".
