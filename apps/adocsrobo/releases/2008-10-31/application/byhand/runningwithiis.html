<h1>Setting up IIS and php.</h1>
<p>Be sure you completed all the steps in [[Running On Windows]] before proceding to these steps</p>
<p>These steps can  be troublesome only because different versions of windows have different versions of IIS and different versions of php behave slightly differently. This tutorial is assuming you are installing php 5.2.5 or later. It was developed on Windows XP. Please send notes of differences on different versions of windows to <a href="andro-general@lists.sourceforge.net">andro-general@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<ul>
<li> Go to the "Add/Remove Programs" control panel applet. Select "Add Remove Windows Components." Install IIS and the World Wide Web publishing service.</li>
<li> Ensure that the "IIS Admin Service" and "World Wide Web Publishing Service" is set to automatic and started in the Services msc plugin. (Goto Start | Run and type "services.msc").</li>
<li> </li>
<li> Download the MSI installer for php from <a href="http://us3.php.net/get/php-5.2.5-win32-installer.msi/from/a/mirror">A local mirror.</a></li>
<li> Run the installer.</li>
	<ul>
	<li> Select IIS as the web server</li>
	<li> Startup regedit and load the registry key
	"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PHP." Add a string called IniFilePath and 
	set it to "C:\Program Files\PHP," or whever you installed php. You can
	just copy the value of the installdir value in the same key.
	I am considering filing a bug report with the php people to add that
	value at install time if you select IIS ISAPI as your web server.</li>
	<li>Edit php.ini. Enable php_pgsql.dll and tweak the other
	sections.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Now would be a good time to make a hello.php file and make sure IIS is 
working right.</li>
</ul>
