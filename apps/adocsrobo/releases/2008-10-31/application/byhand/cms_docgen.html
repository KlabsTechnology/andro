<p>
NOTE: The information on this page is subject to change.  We are currently
perfecting the documentation system in a separate project called 'cms', and
when that is finished it will be moved into Andromeda as a library.
</p>

<p>
You can embed documentation into your code that will be read and processed
by the [[x_docgen]] program.
</p>

<p>
A comment should begin with "/**" and end with "*\/".  Every line before
the first blank line has parameters, everything after the first blank line
is taken to be the content.
</p>

<p>
Parameter lines go as "name:value", followed by a newline.  The parsing
program is very particular, it does not like whitespace in front of the
name, and it wants the entire name:value pair on a single line.  If it
cannot find a colon on a line it quietly ignores the line.
</p>

<p>
'name', will be the name of the entry.  This should be description, including
spaces and punctuation where necessary.  Do not use this for methods or
functions, use it for everything else.  There can be only one 'name' or
'function' in each entry.  If there are more than one the last one wins
and overwrites earlier ones.
</p>

<p>
'function', is the name of an entry when the entry is a function or
method.  There can be only one 'name' or
'function' in each entry.  If there are more than one the last one wins
and overwrites earlier ones.
</p>

<p>
'parm' names a parameter.  You can put any number of these.  They are
ignored unless 'function' was used.
</p>

<p>
'returns' should list the return type.  You can only have one, if there is
more than one the last one will overwrite previous ones.  They are ignored
unless 'function' is used.
</p>

<p>
'parent' names the parent value.
</p>

<p>
If 'parent' is not specified the entry is quietly ignored.  If neither
'name' nor 'function' is specified the entry is quietly ignored.
</p>

<p>
You can also specify 'flag:framework' and a special note will be inserted
that says basically, "this is a framework function!"
</p>

<p>
You can make an entry with the name "_default_", and any parameters you
specify for that entry will apply to all entries that follow within the
same program file.  This is most useful for specifying the "parent" property
for several functions or doc blocks.
</p>

<p>
Each time you create a "name:_default_" block the previous defaults are
discarded.
