                            <p>string Table_id<br/>string First_Letters<br/>array rows<br/><br/><br/>Returns an array of rows that can be put into a drop-down select box.
The first column is always "_value" and the second is always "_display".
</p>
<p>The second parameter, if provided, filters to the results so that
only values of _display that start with "First_Letters" are returned.
</p>
<p>For a multiple-column primary key, this routine will filter for any pk
column that exists in the session array "ajaxvars".  This feature is
controlled by an (as-yet undocumented) feature in [[ahInputsComprehensive]]
that can make inputs use Ajax when their value changes to store their
value in the session on the server.
