                            <p>string type<br/>any Value<br/>int Clip_Length<br/>string<br/><br/><br/>Takes any input value and type and formats it for direct substitution
into a SQL string.  So for instance character values are escaped for
quotes and then surrounded by single quotes.  Numerics are returned
as-is, dates are formatted and so forth.
</p>
<p>The optional third parameter specifies a maximum length for character
and varchar fields.  If it is non-zero, the value will be clipped to
that length.
</p>
<p>If you use this command for every value received from the browser when
you build SQL queries, then your code will be safe from SQL Injection
attacks.  All framework commands that build queries use this command for
all literals provided to them.
