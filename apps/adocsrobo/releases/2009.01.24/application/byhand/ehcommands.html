                            <p>echo<br/><br/><br/>Echos a command window.  In the default Andromeda template there is a module
named "commands".  If this module is activated, it contains the content
generated by the ehCommands routine.  When an alternate template is used
and you want a command window, all you need is a wide bar.

<p>At this writing we are contemplating moving the button bars up into
the command window.
