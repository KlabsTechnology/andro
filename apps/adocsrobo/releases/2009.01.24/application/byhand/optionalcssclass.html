                            <p><br/><br/>Almost all HTML generation functions allow you to specify the
CSS class of the generated element, and almost all of them allow
this to be specified as the first parameter to the function.
</p>
<p>The CSS Class can always be safely passed as an empty string, in which
case no class assignment is made.
