<h1>A Starter Database Specification</h1>

<p>A typical Andromeda database application will contain at least
   one module, at least one security group, and of course one
   table.

<h2>More About Groups</h2>

<p>A "group" in Andromeda is much the same as a security group in 
   any operating system or database system.  The Andromeda programmer
   defines the groups in the database specification, and then assigns
   each group various permissions within modules and tables.
</p>

<h2>More About Modules</h2>

<p>A module is used to group tables together and organize your
   menu system.  Each module becomes
   a drop-down on the admin interface, and each table in the module
   becomes a menu entry.
</p>

<p>Modules can also be used to define default security
