<h1>SVN Downloads Drafted</h1>

<p>The Andromeda Team is proud to announce the addition of code that allows
   downloading of new software versions from SVN repositories.  This allows
   an enterprise develpment effort to handle all source control with SVN
   up to the time of generating a release, and then Andromeda can
   pull the release from the SVN repository.
</p>

<P>One of the earliest elements of the original Andromeda vision was
   Enterprise-level code management.  This means Andromeda must 
   elegantly and easily find the latest versions of applications,
   download them to servers, and be able to build multiple instances
   of an application on a server, even multiple instances at different
   versions.
</p>

<p>Very early on it was decided to meet this goal by building source
   control into Andromeda itself, but we have since "seen the light"
   and realized that the faster route to Enterprise readiness lies
   in using SVN for source control, and then letting Andromeda pull
   releases and store them for upgrading end-user instances.
</p>

<p>Andromeda programmers will note the new value "SVN URL" that is
   on the detail page of an application.  This supersedes the now
   deprecated table of Nodes.  The concept of the "authoritative node"
   is now discarded and there is no more table of Nodes and no entry
   for an application's authoritative node.
</p>

<p>For Andromeda itself, use the value 
   "https://andro.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/andro/releases/" and 
   don't forget to include the trailing slash!
</p>

<p>For your own applications, put in a URL that points directly to
   the releases (or sometimes called "tags") folder in your
   SVN tree.
