<h1>New Instructions for Gutsy</h1>

<p>February 5, 2008</p>

<p>The Andromeda team is very happy to announce that we have simplified
   and corrected the installation instructions specifically for
   Ubuntu Version 7.10, aka "Gutsy Gibbon".  
</p>

<p>The revised instructions group tasks together by user context, so
   that all command-line commands come first, followed by file edits,
   then server restarts, program configs, and finally the Andromeda
   configuration itself.  These instructions do not expect you to be
   a Linux guru, and they follow completely the conventions for other
   instructions you will find on Ubuntu forums.
</p>

<p>We perfected these instructions by installing Ubuntu 7.10 into
   a virtual machine and then taking a "snapshot" of the system just
   after installation and system updates.  We went through the
   install a few times, more than once rolling back to the snapshot
   until we could get the entire installation done without a hitch
   from the beginning to the end.  The result is 
<a href="http://www.andromeda-project.org/pages/cms/Installing+Andromeda+on+Ubuntu+7.10.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>We are now planning to proceed directly to Ubuntu 6.10 and Ubuntu
   8.04.  We will also do Windows XP and Windows 2003 in the same
   manner.  There are no plans at this time to do any other operating
   systems.  Specifically we have no plans to do Ubuntu 7.04 or
   Windows Vista.  
</p>

<p>Of course, if we could run OS X inside of a virtual machine 
   then we'd soon have those instructions....
