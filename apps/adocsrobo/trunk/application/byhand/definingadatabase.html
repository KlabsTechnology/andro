<h1>Defining a Database</h1>
                            
<P>
Andromeda places a very high emphasis on the database. This emphasis 
is very much greater than any other web framework or database framework 
that we know of.

<P>
Most of the advantages of Andromeda come from knowing how to use its 
very powerful database specification language to put all (or nearly all) 
of your business rules into the database specification. When this is 
done, you get <SPAN CLASS="T1">synchronization</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="T2"> 
for free â€“ the structure of your tables exactly matches your code and 
the specification can be used to generate database technical documentation.</SPAN>
