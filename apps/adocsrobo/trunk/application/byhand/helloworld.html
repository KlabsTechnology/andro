<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>Andromeda aims to keep simple things simple and to make
   complicated things manageable.
   With that in mind, a basic Hello World! program is a very simple
   thing to do.  The following code snippet demonstrates this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
<?php 
class x6helloworld extends androX6 {
    function x6main {
        ?>
        Hello World!
        <?php
    }
}
?>
</pre>

<p>As we can see, every Andromeda page exists as a PHP file that has
   a class in it.  The class always extends the built-in class "androX6"
   (note the case, the "X" is uppercase the rest is lowercase).  The
   class itself is always named "x6" plus the name of the page:
</p>


<h4>x6 + {pageName} = x6helloworld</h4>

<p>This program should be saved in a file named "x6helloworld.php" in
   your application directory.  
</p>

<p>To see this page, go to your application, log in, and then type into
   the address bar "/path/to/app/index.php?x6page=helloworld".
</p>

<span class="warning">Linux file names are case-sensitive.  You must name
your file using the exact case that you provide to the x6page parameter.
</span>

<p>The x6main should send its HTML directly to output.  There is no
   need to worry about buffering, Andromeda takes care of that.
