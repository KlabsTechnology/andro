<h1>Basic Database Commands</h1>
                            
<p>
Andromeda provides a handful of basic database routines that serve several
purposes.  The primary purpose is simply to have efficient routines
that reduce the code you need in your application.

<p>
Multi-platform abstraction can always be added later if all basic
SQL commands are wrapped, so this is also a goal, though at this time
Andromeda targets only the Postgres database.
