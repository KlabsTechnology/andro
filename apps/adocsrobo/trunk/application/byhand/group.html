                            <p><br/><br/>An Andromeda database specification will contain security assignments.
The security system is based on the idea of assigning rights to groups.
Any particular security assignment allows a group of users to access
a table (or rows and columns within a table).

<p>The database specification contains the group definitions, and the granting
of priveleges to those groups.  Priveleges are granted to tables  with the
definitions [[module.group]], [[group.module]], and [[table.group]].
Column-level security can be granted with <span class="nolink">table.column#permsel</span> and
<span class="nolink">table.column#permupd</span>.  Row-level security can be granted with
<span class="nolink">table.column#permrow</span>.
</p>
<p>Any privelege granted within a group definition will apply to all tables
in the database.  These defaults are overridden by assignments made in
[[module.group]], [[group.module]], and [[table.group]].
</p>
<p>For an actual user to gain priveleges, a <span class="nolink">user administrator</span> must
add them to one or more groups at runtime.
</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p> 
<b>group group_id</b>.  The first line of a group definition begins with
the keyword 'group', a space, and then the unique group name (group_id)
followed by a colon.
</p>
<p> 
<b>description</b>.  The friendly description of the group.
</p>
<p> 
<b>permsel</b>.  The group's default SELECT permission database-wide.
</p>
<p> 
<b>permins</b>.  The group's default INSERT permission database-wide.
</p>
<p> 
<b>permupd</b>.  The group's default UPDATE permission database-wide.
</p>
<p> 
<b>permdel</b>.  The group's default DELETE permission database-wide.
</p>
<p> 
<b>permrole</b>.  If Y, members of this group may create new users and
assign privileges.  Any user who is put into this group has effective
total control of the application, as they can assign any kind of
security to themselves or others.
</p>
<p> 
<b>solo</b>.  If Y, members of this group may not belong to any other
group (except the login group).  Note that this feature is <i>subvertible</i>
under very specific circumstances.  Users with <b>permrole</b> authority
who have direct access to a database console can assign other users into
any group or combination of groups without regard for this setting.
</p>
<p>Within a group definition you can further define the group's permissions
for specific modules by including [[group.module]] defintions.
</p>
<p>There is a hard-coded group known as the $LOGIN group.  The group is
not actually named '$LOGIN', it always takes the name of the database,
such as 'andro' or 'finance'.  If you wish to make assignments to this
default group, such as allowing that group SELECT access to some tables,
you can make assignments to the $LOGIN group.
