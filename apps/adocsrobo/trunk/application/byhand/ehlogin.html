                            <p>string CSS_Class<br/>string DOM_ID<br/>string Username<br/>bool horizontal<br/>echo<br/> <br/>Provides a login/logout box on the screen.<br/><br/><br/>This routine outputs one of two things.  If a user is logged in,
it says, "Welcome -Username-!" and gives a logout button.  If nobody
is logged in, it presents a login box and a password box.
</p>
<p>The output is inside of a table.  The items are stacked on top of
each other, so the first row says "Username:" and the second row has
a textbox, the third row says "Password:" and the fourth row has
another textbox, and finally the fifth row has a submit button.
</p>
<p>If CSS_Class is provided, the TABLE and TD elements will both get
that class asignment.  If the DOM_ID element is provided, the TABLE
and TD elements will all get that ID assignment.
</p>
<p>If the third parameter, Username, is provided, that will be the default
entry in the UserID box.
