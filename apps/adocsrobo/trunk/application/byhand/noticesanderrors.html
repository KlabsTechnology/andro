            <h1>Notices and Errors</h1>
                            
                            <p><br/><br/>Andromeda supports (and in fact requires) delayed error reporting.
</p>
<p>When an error occurs in code, the error is saved temporarily using
[[ErrorAdd]], and execution then always continues to the end.  The
errors are then reported when the HTML is sent to the browser.
</p>
<p>There can be multiple errors in one request.  Any framework function
that sends commands to the database server will also take database
server errors and run them through [[ErrorAdd]] so that they can be
reported.
</p>
<p>An error is anything at all that causes the user's expected action
not to occur.  A notice is information that the user may need that is
not an error.
</p>
<p>The Andromeda default screens report all errors and notices.
When you make a completely custom screen or template, you must make
provision to report errors and notices.
