The basics:

1. pull down the latest Andromeda release from sourceforge
2. Overlay these files onto it at the andro level:
	-> top level files are in the top directory
	-> debian folder should go alongside application, lib, etc.
	-> application/* files should go into application

3. Follow instructions on website for building a deb package.
